<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the following pages the term skeleton is used in its
widest sense, so as to include exoskeletal or tegumentary
structures, as well as endoskeletal structures. It was thought
advisable to include some account of the skeleton of the
lowest Chordata&mdash;animals which are not strictly vertebrates,
but it seemed undesirable to alter the title of the book in
consequence.</p>

<p>The plan adopted in the treatment of each group has
been to give first an account of the general skeletal characters
of the group in question and of its several subdivisions;
secondly to describe in detail the skeleton of one or more
selected types; and thirdly to treat the skeleton as developed
in the group organ by organ.</p>

<p>A beginner is advised to commence, not with the introductory
chapter, but with the skeleton of the Dogfish, then
to pass to the skeletons of the Newt and Frog, and then
to that of the Dog. After that he might pass to the introductory
chapter and work straight through the book. I have
endeavoured to make the account of each type skeleton
complete in itself; this has necessitated a certain amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
repetition,&mdash;a fault that I have found it equally difficult to
avoid in other parts of the book.</p>

<p>Throughout the book generic names are printed in italics;
and italics are used in the accounts of the type skeletons for
the names of membrane bones. Clarendon type is used to
emphasise certain words. In the classificatory table the
names of extinct genera only, are printed in italics.</p>

<p>In a book in which an attempt is made to cover to some
extent such a vast field, it would be vain to hope to have
avoided many errors both of omission and commission, and
I owe it to the kindness of several friends that the errors are
not much more numerous. I cannot however too emphatically
say that for those which remain I alone am responsible.
Messrs C.W. Andrews, E. Fawcett, S.F. Harmer, J. Graham
Kerr, and B. Rogers have all been kind enough to help me
by reading proofs or manuscript, while the assistance that I
have received from Dr Gadow during the earlier stages and
from Prof. Lloyd Morgan and Mr Shipley throughout the
whole progress of the work has been very great. To all these
gentlemen my best thanks are tendered.</p>

<p>All the figures except 1, 35, 55, and 84 were drawn by
Mr Edwin Wilson, to whose care and skill I am much indebted.
The majority are from photographs taken by my
sister Miss K.M. Reynolds or by myself in the British
Museum and in the Cambridge University Museum of
Zoology, and I take this opportunity of thanking Sir W.H.
Flower and Mr S.F. Harmer for the facilities they have
afforded and for permission to figure many objects in the
museums respectively under their charge. I have also to
thank (1) Prof. von Zittel for permission to reproduce figs. 27,
41, 52, 69, 70, 80, 106 <span class="smcap">A</span>, and 107 <span class="smcap">C</span>; (2) Sir W.H. Flower
and Messrs A. and C. Black for figs. 1 and 84; (3) Prof. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>O.C.
Marsh and Dr H. Woodward for fig. 35; (4) Dr C.H. Hurst
and Messrs Smith, Elder, and Co. for fig. 55.</p>

<p>A few references are given, but no attempt has been made
to give anything like a complete list. The abbreviations
of the titles of periodicals are those used in the <i>Zoological
Record</i>.</p>

<p>I have always referred freely to the textbooks treating of
the subjects dealt with, and in particular I should like to
mention that the section devoted to the skeleton of mammals
is, as it could hardly fail to be, to a considerable extent based
on Sir W.H. Flower's <i>Osteology of the Mammalia</i>.</p>

<small>INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN
GENERAL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the term <b>skeleton</b> is meant the hard structures whose
function is to support or to protect the softer tissues of the
animal body.</p>

<p>The skeleton is divisible into</p>

<p>A. The <span class="smcap">Exoskeleton</span>, which is external;</p>

<p>B. The <span class="smcap">Endoskeleton</span>, which is as a rule internal;
though in some cases, e.g. the antlers of deer, endoskeletal
structures become, as development proceeds, external.</p>

<p>In Invertebrates the hard, supporting structures of the
body are mainly <b>exoskeletal</b>, in Vertebrates they are mainly
<b>endoskeletal</b>; but the endoskeleton includes, especially in
the skull, a number of elements, the <b>dermal</b> or <b>membrane</b>
bones, which are shown by development to have been originally
of external origin. These membrane bones are so intimately
related to the true endoskeleton that they will be described
with it. The simplest and lowest types of both vertebrate
and invertebrate animals have unsegmented skeletons; with
the need for flexibility however segmentation arose both in
the case of the invertebrate exoskeleton and the vertebrate
endoskeleton. The exoskeleton in vertebrates is phylogenetically
older than the endoskeleton, as is indicated by both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
palaeontology and embryology. Palaeontological evidence is
afforded by the fact that all the lower groups of vertebrates&mdash;Fish,
Amphibia, and Reptiles&mdash;had in former geological periods
a greater proportion of species protected by well-developed
dermal armour than is the case at present. Embryological
evidence tends the same way, inasmuch as dermal ossifications
appear much earlier in the developing animal than do the
ossifications in the endoskeleton.</p>

<p>Skeletal structures may be derived from each of the three
germinal layers. Thus <b>hairs</b> and <b>feathers</b> are <b>epiblastic</b> in
origin, <b>bones</b> are <b>mesoblastic</b>, and the <b>notochord</b> is <b>hypoblastic</b>.</p>

<p>The different types of skeletal structures may now be considered
and classified more fully.</p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">Exoskeletal structures.</span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Epiblastic</span> (epidermal).</p>

<p>Exoskeletal structures of epiblastic origin may be developed
on both the inner and outer surfaces of the Malpighian layer of
the epidermis<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> . Those developed on the outer surface include
<b>hairs</b>, <b>feathers</b>, <b>scales</b>, <b>nails</b>, <b>beaks</b> and <b>tortoiseshell</b>; and
are specially found in vertebrates higher than fishes. Those
developed on the inner surface of the Malpighian layer include
only the <b>enamel</b> of teeth and some kinds of scales. With
the exception of feathers, which are partly formed from the
horny layer, all these parts are mainly derived from the Malpighian
layer of the epidermis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hairs</b> are slender, elongated structures which arise by
the proliferation of cells from the Malpighian layer of the
epidermis. These cells in the case of each hair form a short
papilla, which sinks inwards and becomes imbedded at the
bottom of a follicle in the dermis. Each hair is normally
composed of an inner cellular pithy portion containing much
air, and an outer denser cortical portion of a horny nature.
Sometimes, as in Deer, the hair is mainly formed of the pithy
portion, and is then easily broken. Sometimes the horny part
predominates, as in the bristles of Pigs. A highly vascular
dermal papilla projects into the base of the hair.</p>

<p><b>Feathers</b>, like hairs, arise from epidermal papillae which
become imbedded in pits in the dermis. But the feather germ
differs from the hair germ, in the fact that it first grows
out like a cone on the surface of the epidermis, and that
the horny as well as the Malpighian layer takes part in its
formation.</p>

<p><b>Nails</b>, <b>claws</b>, <b>hoofs</b>, and the <b>horns of Oxen</b> are also
epidermal, as are such structures as the <b>scales</b> of reptiles, of
birds' feet, and of <i>Manis</i> among mammals, the <b>rattle</b> of the
rattlesnake, the <b>nasal horns</b> of <i>Rhinoceros</i>, and the <b>baleen</b>
of whales. All these structures will be described later.</p>

<p><b>Nails</b> arise in the interior of the epidermis by the thickening
and cornification of the stratum lucidum. The outer
border of the nail soon becomes free, and growth takes place
by additions to the inner surface and attached end.</p>

<p>When a nail tapers to a sharp point it is called a <b>claw</b>.
In many cases the nails more or less surround the ends of
the digits by which they are borne.</p>

<p>Horny <b>beaks</b> of epidermal origin occur casing the jaw-bones
in several widely distinct groups of animals. Thus
among reptiles they are found in Chelonia (tortoises and
turtles) as well as in some extinct forms; they occur in all
living birds, in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> among mammals, and in the
larvae of many Amphibia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few animals, such as Lampreys and <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>,
the jaws bear horny tooth-like structures of epidermal origin.</p>

<p>The <b>enamel</b> of teeth and of placoid scales is also epiblastic
in origin<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> , and it may be well at this point to give
some account of the structure of teeth, though they are
partly mesoblastic in origin. The simplest teeth are those
met with in sharks and dogfish, where they are merely the
slightly modified scales developed in the integument of the
mouth. They pass by quite insensible gradations into normal
placoid scales, such as cover the general surface of the body.
A <b>placoid scale</b><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is developed on a papilla of the dermis
which projects outwards and backwards, and is covered by the
columnar Malpighian layer of the epidermis. The outer layer
of the dermal papilla then gradually becomes converted into
dentine and bone, while enamel is developed on the inner side
of the Malpighian layer, forming a cap to the scale. The
Malpighian and horny layers of the epidermis get rubbed off
the enamel cap, so that it comes to project freely on the surface
of the body.</p>

<p>As regards their attachment teeth may be (1) attached
to the fibrous integument of the mouth, or (2) fixed to the
jaws or other bones of the mouth, or (3) planted in grooves,
or (4) in definite sockets in the jaw-bones (see p. 107).</p>

<p>Teeth in general consist of three tissues, <b>enamel</b>, <b>dentine</b>
and <b>cement</b>, enclosing a central pulp-cavity containing blood-vessels
and nerves. Enamel is, however, often absent, as in all
living Edentates.</p>

<p><b>Enamel</b> generally forms the outermost layer of the crown
or visible part of the tooth; it is the hardest tissue occurring
in the animal body and consists of prismatic fibres arranged at
right angles to the surface of the tooth. It is characterised by
its bluish-white translucent appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Mesoblastic</span> (mesodermal).</p>

<p><b>Dentine</b> or <b>ivory</b> generally forms the main mass of a
tooth. It is a hard, white substance allied to bone. When
examined microscopically dentine is seen to be traversed by
great numbers of nearly parallel branching tubules which
radiate outwards from the pulp-cavity. In fishes as a rule,
and sometimes in other animals, a variety of dentine containing
blood-vessels occurs, this is called <b>vasodentine</b>.</p>

<p><b>Cement</b> or <b>crusta petrosa</b> forms the outermost layer of
the root of the tooth. In composition and structure it is
practically identical with bone. In the more complicated
mammalian teeth, besides enveloping the root, it fills up the
spaces between the folds of the enamel.</p>

<p>The hard parts of a tooth commonly enclose a central pulp-cavity
into which projects the pulp, a papilla of the dermis
including blood-vessels and nerves. As long as growth continues
the outer layers of this pulp become successively calcified
and added to the substance of the dentine. In young growing
teeth the pulp-cavity remains widely open, but in mammals
the general rule is that as a tooth gets older and the crown
becomes fully formed, the remainder of the pulp becomes
converted into one or more tapering roots which are imbedded
in the alveolar cavities of the jaws. The opening of
the pulp-cavity is then reduced to a minute perforation at the
base of each root. A tooth of this kind is called a <b>rooted</b>
tooth.</p>

<p>But it is not only in young teeth that the pulp-cavity
sometimes remains widely open; for some teeth, such as the
tusks of Elephants and the incisor teeth of Rodents, form
no roots and continue to grow throughout the animal's
life. Such teeth are said to be rootless or to have persistent
pulps.</p>

<p>An intermediate condition is seen in some teeth, such as
the grinding teeth of Horses. These teeth grow for a very
long time, their crowns wearing away as fast as their bases
are produced; finally however definite roots are formed and
growth ceases.</p>

<p>I. Incisor or tusk of elephant, with pulp-cavity persistently open at
base. II. Human incisor during development with root imperfectly
formed, and pulp-cavity widely open at base. III. Completely formed
human incisor, with pulp-cavity contracted to a small aperture at the
end of the root. IV. Human molar with broad crown and two roots.
V. Molar of Ox, with the enamel covering the crown, deeply folded and

the enamel coating would be continuous at the top of the ridges.
In all the figures the enamel is black, the pulp white, the dentine
represented by horizontal lines, and the cement by dots.</p>
</div>

<p>The teeth of any animal may be <b>homodont</b>, that is, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
having the same general character, or <b>heterodont</b>, that is,
having different forms adapted to different functions. The
dentition is heterodont in a few reptiles and the majority of
mammals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Succession of teeth.</span> In most fishes, and many amphibians
and reptiles the teeth can be renewed indefinitely. In sharks,
for example, numerous rows of reserve teeth are to be seen
folded back behind those in use (see fig. 15). The majority of
mammals have only two sets of teeth, and are said to be <b>diphyodont</b>;
some have only a single series (<b>monophyodont</b>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Development of teeth.</span> A brief sketch of the method in
which development of teeth takes place in the higher vertebrates
may here be given. Along the surface of the jaws a
thickening of the epiblastic epithelium takes place, giving rise
to a ridge, which sinks inwards into the tissue of the jaw,
and it is known as the primary enamel organ. At the points
where teeth are to be developed special ingrowths of this
primary enamel organ take place, and into each there projects
a vascular dental papilla from the surrounding mesoblast of
the jaw. Each ingrowth of the enamel organ forms an
<b>enamel cap</b>, which gradually embraces the dental papilla,
and at the same time appears to be pushed on one side, owing
to the growth not being uniform. The external layer of
the dental papilla is composed of long nucleated cells, the
<b>odontoblasts</b>, and it is by these that the dentine is formed.
Similarly the internal layer of the enamel organ is formed of
columnar enamel cells, which give rise to the enamel. The
mesoblastic cells surrounding the base of the tooth give rise
to the cement.</p>

<p><b>Bone</b> is in many cases exoskeletal, but it will be most
conveniently described with the endoskeleton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>scales of fish</b> are wholly or in part mesoblastic
in origin, being totally different from those of reptiles. The
<b>cycloid</b> and <b>ctenoid</b> scales of Teleosteans (see p. <a href="#Page_105">105</a>) are thin
plates coated with epidermis. They are sometimes bony, but
as a rule are simply calcified. <b>Ganoid</b> scales are flat plates
of bone coated with an enamel-like substance, and articulating
together with a peg and socket arrangement; they are probably
identical with enlarged and flattened placoid scales.</p>

<p>The <b>armour plates</b> of fossil Ganoids, Labyrinthodonts,
and Dinosaurs, and of living Crocodiles, some Lizards and
Armadillos, are composed of bone. They are always covered
by a layer of epidermis.</p>

<p>The <b>antlers of deer</b> are also composed of bone; they
will be more fully described in the chapter on mammals.
It may perhaps be well to mention them here, though they
really belong to the endoskeleton, being outgrowths from the
frontal bones.</p>


<p>B. <span class="smcap">Endoskeletal structures.</span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Hypoblastic.</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <b>notochord</b> is an elastic rod formed of large
vacuolated cells, and is surrounded by a membranous sheath
of mesoblastic origin. It is the primitive endoskeleton in
the Chordata, all of which possess it at some period of their
existence; while in many of the lower forms it persists throughout
life. Even in the highest Chordata it is the sole representative
of the axial skeleton for a considerable part of the
early embryonic life. A simple unsegmented notochord
persists throughout life in the Cephalochordata, Cyclostomata,
and some Pisces, such as Sturgeons and Chimaeroids.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The enamel of the pharyngeal teeth of the Salmon
and many other Teleosteans is hypoblastic in origin. The
epiblast of the stomodaeum, in which the other teeth are
developed, passes into the hypoblast of the mesenteron in
which these pharyngeal teeth are formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>


<p>II. <span class="smcap">Mesoblastic.</span></p>

<p>The most primitive type of a mesoblastic endoskeleton
consists of a membranous sheath surrounding the notochord,
as in <i>Myxine</i> and its allies. The first stage of complication
is by the development of cartilage in the notochordal sheath,
as in <i>Petromyzon</i>. Often the cartilage becomes calcified in
places, as in the vertebral centra of <i>Scyllium</i> and other Elasmobranchs.
Lastly, the formation of bone takes place; it
generally constitutes the most important of the endoskeletal
structures.</p>

<p><b>Bone</b> may be formed in two ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) by the direct ossification of pre-existing cartilage,
when it is known as <b>cartilage bone</b> or <b>endochondral bone</b>;</p>

<p>(2) by independent ossification in connective tissue; it is
then known as <b>membrane</b> or <b>dermal</b> or <b>periosteal bone</b>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the <i>clavicle</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> all the bones of the trunk
and limbs, together with a large proportion of those of the
skull, are preformed in the embryo in cartilage, and are grouped
as cartilage bones; while the clavicle and most of the roofing
and jaw-bones of the skull are not preformed in cartilage, being
developed simply in connection with a membrane. Hence it
is customary to draw a very strong line of distinction between
these two kinds of bone; in reality however this distinction
is often exaggerated, and the two kinds pass into one another,
and as will be shown immediately, the permanent osseous
tissue of many of those which are generally regarded as
typical cartilage bones, is really to a great extent of periosteal
origin. The palatine bone, for instance, of the higher vertebrates
in general is preceded by a cartilaginous bar, but is
itself almost entirely a membrane bone.</p>

<p>Before describing the development of bone it will be well
to briefly describe the structure of adult bone and cartilage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The commonest kind of <b>cartilage</b>, and that which preforms
so many of the bones of the embryo, is <b>hyaline</b> cartilage.
It consists of oval nucleated cells occupying cavities (<b>lacunae</b>)
in a clear intercellular semitransparent matrix, which is probably
secreted by the cells. Sometimes one cell is seen in each
lacuna, sometimes shortly after cell-division a lacuna may contain
two or more cells. The free surface of the cartilage
is invested by a fibrous membrane, the <b>perichondrium</b>.</p>

<p><b>Bone</b> consists of a series of lamellae of ossified substance
between which are oval spaces, the <b>lacunae</b>, giving rise to
numerous fine channels, the <b>canaliculi</b>, which radiate off in
all directions. The lacunae are occupied by the <b>bone cells</b>
which correspond to cartilage cells, from which if the bone is
young, processes pass off into the canaliculi. It is obvious
that the ossified substance of bone is intercellular in character,
and corresponds to the matrix of cartilage.</p>

<p>Bone may be compact, or loose and spongy in character,
when it is known as <b>cancellous bone</b>. In compact bone
many of the lamellae are arranged concentrically round
cavities, the <b>Haversian canals</b>, which in life are occupied by
blood-vessels. Each Haversian canal with its lamellae forms
a <b>Haversian system</b>. In spongy bone instead of Haversian
canals there occur large irregular spaces filled with marrow,
which consists chiefly of blood-vessels and fatty tissue. The
centre of a long bone is generally occupied by one large continuous
marrow cavity. The whole bone is surrounded by
a fibrous connective tissue membrane, <b>the periosteum</b>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The development of bone.</span></p>

<p><b>Periosteal ossification.</b> An example of a bone entirely
formed in this way is afforded by the parietal. The
first trace of ossification is shown by the appearance, below
the membrane which occupies the place of the bone in the
early embryo, of calcareous spicules of bony matter, which
are laid down round themselves by certain large cells, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<b>osteoblasts</b>. These osteoblasts gradually get surrounded by
the matter which they secrete and become converted into bone
cells, and in this way a mass of spongy bone is gradually produced.
Meanwhile a definite periosteum has been formed round
the developing bone, and on its inner side fresh osteoblasts
are produced, and these with the others gradually render the
bone larger and more and more compact. Finally, the middle
layer of the bone becomes again hollowed out and rendered
spongy by the absorption of part of the bony matter.</p>

<p><b>Endochondral ossification</b><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. This is best studied in the
case of a long bone like the femur or humerus. Such a long
bone consists of a shaft, which forms the main part, and two
terminal portions, which form the <b>epiphyses</b>, or portions
ossifying from centres distinct from that forming the shaft or
main part of the bone.</p>

<p>In the earliest stage the future bone consists of hyaline
cartilage surrounded by a vascular sheath, the perichondrium.</p>

<p>Then, starting from the centre, the cartilage becomes permeated
by a number of channels into which pass vessels from
the perichondrium and osteoblasts. In this way the centre
of the developing shaft becomes converted into a mass of
cavities separated by bands or trabeculae of cartilage. This
cartilage next becomes calcified, but as yet is not converted
into true bone. The osteoblasts in connection with the
cavities now begin to deposit true endochondral spongy bone,
and then after a time this becomes absorbed by certain
large cells, the osteoclasts, and resolved into marrow or vascular
tissue loaded with fat. So that the centre of the shaft
passes from the condition of hyaline cartilage to that of
calcified cartilage, thence to the condition of spongy bone, and
finally to that of marrow. At the same time beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
perichondrium osteoblasts are developed which also begin to
give rise to spongy bone. The perichondrium thus becomes
the periosteum, and the bone produced by it, is periosteal or
membrane bone. So that while a continuous marrow cavity is
gradually being formed in the centre of the shaft, the layer of
periosteal bone round the margin is gradually thickening, and
becoming more and more compact by the narrowing down of its
cavities to the size of Haversian canals. The absorption of
endochondral and formation of periosteal bone goes on, till
in time it comes about that the whole of the shaft, except
its terminations, is of periosteal origin. At the extremities
of the shaft, however, and at the epiphyses, each of which
is for a long time separated from the shaft by a pad of
cartilage, the ossification is mainly endochondral, the periosteal
bone being represented only by a thin layer.</p>

<p>Until the adult condition is reached and growth ceases, the
pad of cartilage between the epiphysis and the shaft continues
to grow, its outer (epiphysial) half growing by the formation of
fresh cartilage as fast as its inner half is encroached on by the
growth of bone from the shaft. The terminal or articular
surfaces of the bone remain throughout life covered by layers
of articular cartilage.</p>

<p>Even after the adult condition is reached the bone is
subject to continual change, processes of absorption and fresh
formation going on for a time and tending to render the bone
more compact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Methods in which bones are united to one another.</span></p>

<p>The various bones composing the endoskeleton are united
to one another either by <b>sutures</b> or by movable <b>joints</b>.</p>

<p>When two bones are suturally united, their edges fit
closely together and often interlock, being also bound together
by the periosteum.</p>

<p>In many cases this sutural union passes into fusion or
<b>ankylosis</b>, ossification extending completely from one bone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the other with the obliteration of the intervening suture. This
feature is especially well marked in the cranium of most birds.</p>

<p>The various kinds of joints or articulations<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> may be subdivided
into imperfect joints and perfect joints.</p>

<p>In <b>imperfect joints</b>, such as the intervertebral joints of
mammals, the two contiguous surfaces are united by a mass
of fibrous tissue which allows only a limited amount of motion.</p>

<p>In <b>perfect joints</b> the contiguous articular surfaces are
covered with cartilage, and between them lies a synovial
membrane which secretes a viscid lubricating fluid.</p>

<p>The amount of motion possible varies according to the
nature of the articular surfaces; these include&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <b>ball and socket joints</b>, like the hip and shoulder, in
which the end of one bone works in a cup provided by another,
and movements can take place in a variety of planes.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <b>hinge joints</b>, like the elbow and knee, in which as
in ball-and-socket joints one bone works in a cup provided
by another, but movements can take place in one plane only.</p>


<p class="cen">THE ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton is divisible into <b>axial</b> and <b>appendicular</b>
parts; and the <b>axial</b> skeleton into&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">
1. the spinal column,<br />
<br />
2. the skull {<i>a.</i> the cranium,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.7em;">{<i>b.</i> the jaws and visceral skeleton,</span><br />
<br />
3. the ribs and sternum<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.<br />
</p>


<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Spinal column.</span></p>

<p>The spinal column in the simplest cases consists of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
unsegmented rod, the notochord, surrounded by the <b>skeletogenous
layer</b>, a sheath of mesoblastic origin, which also
envelops the nerve cord. Several intermediate stages connect
this simple spinal column with the vertebral column characteristic
of higher vertebrates. A typical vertebral column
may be said to consist of (1) a series of cartilaginous or bony
blocks, the vertebral <b>centra</b>, which arise in the sheath
surrounding the notochord. They cause the notochord to
become constricted and to atrophy to a varying extent, though
a remnant of it persists, either permanently or for a long
period, within each centrum or between successive centra.
(2) From the dorsal surface of each centrum arise a pair of
processes which grow round the spinal cord and unite above
it, forming a <b>dorsal</b> or <b>neural arch</b>. (3) A similar pair
of processes arising from the ventral surface of the centrum
form the <b>ventral</b> or <b>haemal arch</b>. To the ventral arch
the ribs strictly belong, and it tends to surround the ventral
blood-vessels and the body cavity with the alimentary canal
and other viscera.</p>

<p>A <b>neural spine</b> or spinous process commonly projects
upwards from the dorsal surface of the neural arch, and a pair
of <b>transverse processes</b> project outwards from its sides.
When, as is commonly the case, the two halves of the haemal
arch do not meet, the ventral surface of the centrum often
bears a downwardly-projecting <b>hypapophysis</b>.</p>

<p>The character of the surfaces by which vertebral centra
articulate with one another varies much. Sometimes both
surfaces are concave, and the vertebra is then said to be
<b>amphicoelous</b>; sometimes a centrum is convex in front and
concave behind, the vertebra is then <b>opisthocoelous</b>, sometimes
concave in front and convex behind, when the vertebra
is <b>procoelous</b>. Again, in many vertebrae both faces of the
centra are flat, while in others they are saddle-shaped, as in the
neck vertebrae of living birds, or biconvex, as in the case of
the first caudal vertebra of crocodiles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In the higher vertebrates pads of fibrocartilage&mdash;the
<b>intervertebral discs</b>&mdash;are commonly interposed between
successive centra, these or parts of them often ossify, especially
in the trunk and tail, and are then known as <b>inter centra</b>.</p>

<p>The vertebrae of the higher forms can generally be arranged
in the following five groups, each marked by certain special
characteristics:</p>

<p>1. The <b>cervical</b> or <b>neck vertebrae</b>. These connect
the skull with the thorax, and are characterised by relatively
great freedom of movement. They often bear small ribs, but
are distinguished from the succeeding thoracic vertebrae by
the fact that their ribs do not reach the sternum. The first
cervical vertebra which articulates with the skull is called
the <b>atlas</b>, but a study of the nerve exits shows that the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
vertebra is not serially homologous throughout the Ichthyopsida,
so that it is best to reserve the term atlas for the first
vertebra in Sauropsida and Mammalia.</p>

<p>2. The <b>thoracic vertebrae</b> (often called dorsal) bear
movably articulated ribs which unite ventrally with the
sternum.</p>

<p>3. The <b>lumbar vertebrae</b> are generally large, and are
often more movable on one another than are the thoracic
vertebrae. They bear no ribs.</p>

<p>4. The <b>sacral vertebrae</b> are characterised by the fact
that they are firmly fused together, and are united with the
pelvic girdle by means of their transverse processes and rudimentary
ribs.</p>

<p>5. The <b>caudal</b> or <b>tail vertebrae</b> succeed the sacral.
The anterior ones are often fused with one another and with
the sacrals, but they differ from true sacral vertebrae in that
there are no rudimentary ribs between their transverse processes
and the pelvic girdle. They often bear V-shaped
<b>chevron bones</b>.</p>

<p>In fish and snakes the vertebral column is divisible into
only two regions, an anterior trunk region, whose vertebrae bear
ribs, and a posterior tail region, whose vertebrae are ribless.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>Before giving a general account of the adult skull it will
be well to briefly describe its development.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">General development of the Cranium</span><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after its appearance, the central nervous system
becomes surrounded by a membranous mesodermal investment
which in the region of the spinal cord is called the <b>skeletogenous
layer</b> or <b>perichordal sheath</b>, while in the region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the brain it is called the <b>membranous cranium</b>. Ventral
to the central nervous system is the notochord, which extends
far into the region of the future cranium, and like the
nervous system, is enclosed by the skeletogenous layer. The
primitive cartilaginous cranium is formed by histological
differentiation within the substance of the membranous
cranium and always consists of the following parts:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) the <b>parachordals</b>. These are a pair of flat curved
plates of cartilage, each of which has its inner edge grooved
where it comes in contact with the notochord. The parachordals,
together with the notochord, form a continuous
plate, which is known as the <b>basilar plate</b>. The basilar
plate is the primitive floor below the hind- and mid-brain.
In front the parachordals abut upon another pair of cartilaginous
bars, the trabeculae, the two pairs of structures being
sometimes continuous with one another from the first;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) the <b>trabeculae</b> which meet behind and embrace the
front end of the notochord. Further forwards they at first
diverge from one another, and then converge again, enclosing
a space, the <b>pituitary space</b>. After a time they generally
fuse with one another in the middle line, and, with the parachordals
behind, form an almost continuous basal plate. The
trabeculae generally appear before the parachordals. They
form the primitive floor below the fore-brain;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) the cartilaginous <b>capsules</b> of the three pairs of <b>sense
organs</b>. At a very early stage of development involutions
of the surface epiblast give rise to the three pairs of special
sense organs&mdash;the olfactory or nasal organs in front, the optic
in the middle, and the auditory behind. The olfactory and
auditory organs always become enclosed in definite cartilaginous
capsules, the eyes often as in the Salmon, become
enclosed in cartilaginous sclerotic capsules, while sometimes,
as in mammals, their protecting capsules are fibrous.</p>

<p>Each pair of sense capsules comes into relation with part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the primitive cranium, and greatly modifies it. Thus the
auditory or periotic capsules press on the parachordals till
they come to be more or less imbedded in them. Perhaps
owing to the pressure of the nasal capsules the trabeculae
fuse in front, and then grow out into an anterior pair of
processes, the <b>cornua trabeculae</b>, and a posterior pair, the
<b>antorbital processes</b>, which together almost completely surround
the nasal capsules. The sclerotic capsules of the eyes
greatly modify the cranium, although they never become
completely united with it.</p>

<p>The cartilaginous cranium formed of the basal plate, together
with the sense capsules, does not long remain merely
as a floor. Its sides grow vertically upwards, forming the
<b>exoccipital</b> region of the cranium behind, and the <b>alisphenoidal</b>
and <b>orbitosphenoidal</b> regions further forwards.
In many forms, such as Elasmobranchs, all these upgrowths
meet round the brain, roofing it in and forming an almost
complete cartilaginous cranium. But in most vertebrata,
while in the occipital region, the cartilaginous cranium is
completed dorsally, in the alisphenoidal and orbitosphenoidal
regions the cartilage merely forms the lateral walls of the
cranium, the greater part of the brain having dorsal to it a
wide space, closed by merely membranous tissue in connection
with which the large frontal and parietal bones are subsequently
formed.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Skull</span> includes</p>

<p><i>a.</i> the cranium,</p>

<p><i>b.</i> the jaws and visceral skeleton.</p>

<p>The <b>cranium</b> can be further subdivided into</p>

<p>(1) an axial portion, the <b>cranium proper</b> or <b>brain
case</b>;</p>

<p>(2) <b>the sense capsules.</b> The capsules of the auditory
and olfactory sense organs are always present, and as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
already mentioned, in many animals the eye likewise is
included in a cartilaginous capsule.</p>


<p>(1) <span class="smcap">The cranium proper or brain case.</span></p>

<p>The cranium varies much in form and structure. In lower
vertebrates, such as Sharks and Lampreys, it remains entirely
cartilaginous and membranous, retaining throughout life much
of the character of the embryonic rudiment of the cranium of
higher forms. The dogfish's cranium, described on pp. 73 to
76, is a good instance of a cranium of this type. But in the
majority of vertebrates the cartilage becomes more or less
replaced by cartilage bone, while membrane bones are also
largely developed and supplant the cartilage.</p>

<p>The cranium of most vertebrates includes a very large
number of bones whose arrangement varies much, but one
can distinguish a definite <b>basicranial axis</b> formed of the
basi-occipital, basisphenoid, and presphenoid bones, which is
a continuation forwards of the axis of the vertebral column.
From the basicranial axis a wide arch arises, composed of a
number of bones, which form the sides and roof of the brain-case
These bones are arranged in such a manner that if both
cartilage and membrane bones are included they can be divided
into three rings or segments. The hinder one of these segments
is the occipital, the middle the parietal, and the anterior
one the frontal.</p>

<p>The occipital segment is formed of four cartilage bones, the
<b>basi-occipital</b> below, two <b>exoccipitals</b> at the sides, and the
<b>supra-occipital</b> above. The parietal segment is formed of
the <b>basisphenoid</b> below, two <b>alisphenoids</b> at the sides and
two membrane bones, the <i>parietals</i> above, and the frontal
segment in like manner consists of the <b>presphenoid</b> below,
the two <b>orbitosphenoids</b> at the sides, and two membrane
bones, the <i>frontals</i>, above. The parietals and frontals, being
membrane bones, are not comparable to the supra-occipital,
in the way that the presphenoid and basisphenoid are to the
basi-occipital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The cartilage bones of the occipital segments are derived
from the parachordals of the embryonic skull, those of the
parietal and frontal segments from the trabeculae.</p>

<p>In front of the presphenoid the basicranial axis is continued
by the <b>mesethmoid</b>.</p>


<p>(2) <span class="smcap">The sense capsules.</span></p>

<p>These enclose and protect the special sense organs.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Auditory capsule.</b></p>

<p>The basisphenoid is always continuous with the basi-occipital,
but the alisphenoid is not continuous with the exoccipital
as the <b>periotic</b> or <b>auditory capsule</b> is interposed
between them. Each periotic capsule has three principal
ossifications; an anterior bone, the <b>pro-otic</b>, a posterior bone,
the <b>opisthotic</b>, and a superior bone, the <b>epi-otic</b>.</p>

<p>These bones may severally unite, or instead of uniting
with one another they may unite with the neighbouring bones.
Thus the epi-otic often unites with the supra-occipital, and the
opisthotic with the exoccipital.</p>

<p>Two other bones developed in the walls of the auditory
capsule are sometimes added, as in Teleosteans; these are the
<b>pterotic</b> and <b>sphenotic</b>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Optic capsule.</b></p>

<p>The eye is frequently enclosed in a cartilaginous sclerotic
capsule, and in this a number of scale-like bones are often
developed.</p>

<p>Several membrane bones are commonly formed around the
orbit or cavity for the eye. The most constant of these is
the <i>lachrymal</i> which lies in the anterior corner; frequently too,
as in Teleosteans, there is a <i>supra-orbital</i> lying in the upper
part of the orbit, or as in many Reptiles, a <i>postorbital</i> lying in
the posterior part of the orbit.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Nasal capsule.</b></p>

<p>In relation to the nasal capsules various bones occur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The basicranial axis in front of the presphenoid is ossified,
as the <b>mesethmoid</b>, dorsal to which there sometimes, as in
Teleosteans, occur a <i>median ethmoid</i> and a pair of <b>lateral
ethmoids</b><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Two pairs of membrane bones very commonly
occur in this region, viz. the <i>nasals</i> which lie dorsal to the
mesethmoid, and the <i>vomers</i> (sometimes there is only one) which
lie ventral to it.</p>

<p>The part of the skull lying immediately in front of the
cranial cavity and in relation to the nasal capsules constitutes
the <b>ethmoidal region</b>.</p>

<p>There remain certain other membrane bones which are
often found connected with the cranium. Of these, one of
the largest is the <i>parasphenoid</i> which, in Ichthyopsids, is
found underlying the basicranial axis. <i>Prefrontals</i> often, as
in most reptiles, occur lying partly at the sides and partly in
front of the frontal, and <i>postfrontals</i> similarly occur behind the
orbit lying partly behind the frontals and partly at their sides.
Lastly a <i>squamosal bone</i> is, as in Mammals, very commonly
developed, and lies external and partly dorsal to the auditory
capsules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jaws and Visceral Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>In the most primitive fish these consist of a series of
cartilaginous rings or arches placed one behind another and
encircling the anterior end of the alimentary canal. Originally
they are mainly concerned with branchial respiration.</p>

<p>The first or <b>maxillo-mandibular</b> arch forms the upper
jaw and the lower jaw or mandible.</p>

<p>The second or <b>hyoid</b> arch bears gills and often assists
in attaching the jaws to the cranium. The remaining arches
may bear gills, though the last is commonly without them.</p>

<p>The above condition is only found in fishes, in higher
animals the visceral skeleton is greatly reduced and modified.</p>

<p>The first or maxillo-mandibular arch is divisible into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dorsal portion, the <b>palato-pterygo-quadrate bar</b>, which
forms the primitive upper jaw and enters into very close
relations with the cranium, and a ventral portion, <b>Meckel's
cartilage</b>, which forms the primitive lower jaw. The cartilaginous
rudiments of both these portions disappear to a
greater or less extent and become partly ossified, partly replaced
by or enveloped in membrane bone.</p>

<p>The posterior part of the palato-pterygo-quadrate bar becomes
ossified to form the <b>quadrate</b>, the anterior part to form
the palatine and pterygoid, or the two latter may be formed
partially or entirely of periosteal bone, developed round the
cartilaginous bar. Two pairs of important membrane bones,
the <i>premaxillae</i> and <i>maxillae</i> form the anterior part of the
upper jaw, and behind the maxilla lies another membrane
bone, the <i>jugal</i> or <i>malar</i>, which is connected with the quadrate
by a <i>quadratojugal</i>. The premaxillae have a large share in
bounding the external nasal openings or anterior nares.</p>

<p>In lower vertebrates the nasal passage leads directly into
the front part of the mouth cavity and opens by the posterior
nares. In some higher vertebrates, such as mammals and
crocodiles, processes arise from the premaxillae and palatines,
and sometimes from the pterygoids, which meet their fellows
in the middle line and form the palate, shutting off the nasal
passage from the mouth cavity and causing the posterior nares
to open far back.</p>

<p>The cartilage of the lower jaw is in all animals with
ossified skeletons, except the Mammalia, partly replaced by
cartilage bone forming the <b>articular</b>, partly overlain by a
series of membrane bones the <i>dentary</i>, <i>splenial</i>, <i>angular</i>,
<i>supra-angular</i> and <i>coronoid</i>. In many sharks large paired
accessory cartilages occur at the sides of the jaws; and in a
few reptiles and some Amphibia, such as the Frog, the ossified
representative of the anterior of these structures occurs
forming the <b>mento-meckelian</b> bone. In mammals the lower
jaw includes but a single bone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The quadrate in all animals with ossified skeletons, except
the Mammalia, forms the suspensorium of the mandible or the
skeletal link between the jaw and the cranium; in the Mammalia,
however, the mandible articulates with the squamosal,
while the quadrate is greatly reduced, and is now generally
considered to be represented by the tympanic ring of the ear.</p>

<p>The second visceral or hyoid arch in fishes consists of two
pieces of cartilage, a proximal piece the <b>hyomandibular</b>,
and a distal<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
piece the <b>cerato-hyal</b>. The cerato-hyals of the
two sides are commonly united by a median ventral plate, the
<b>basi-hyal</b>. The hyoid arch bears gills on its posterior border,
but its most important function in most fishes is to act as the
suspensorium. In higher vertebrates the representative of
the hyomandibular is much reduced in size, and comes into
relation with the ear forming the <b>auditory ossicles</b>; the
cerato-hyal looses its attachment to the hyomandibular and
becomes directly attached to the cranium, forming a large part
of the hyoid apparatus of most higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>Behind the hyoid arch come the branchial arches. They
are best developed in fishes, in which they are commonly five
in number and bear gills. Their ventral ends are united in
pairs by median pieces, the <b>copulae</b>.</p>

<p>In higher vertebrates they become greatly reduced, and
all except the first and second completely disappear. In the
highest vertebrates, the mammals, the second has disappeared,
but in birds and many reptiles it is comparatively well
developed.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Ribs and Sternum.</span></p>

<p>The <b>ribs</b> are a series of segmentally arranged cartilaginous
or bony rods, attached to the vertebrae; they tend
to surround the body cavity, and to protect the organs
contained within it. Ribs are very frequently found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
attached to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, but a
study of their origin in fish shows that they are really the
cut off terminations of the ventral arch, not of the transverse
processes which are outgrowths from the dorsal arch. In the
tail their function is to surround and protect structures like
the ventral blood-vessels which do not vary much in size,
consequently they meet one another, and form a series of
complete ventral or haemal arches. But the trunk contains
organs like the lungs and stomach which are liable to vary
much in size at different times, consequently the halves of the
haemal arch do not meet ventrally, and then the ribs become
detached from the rest of the haemal arch. Having once
become detached, they are able to shift about and unite themselves
to various points of the vertebra. They frequently, as
has been already mentioned, become entirely attached to the
transverse process, or they may be attached to the transverse
process by a dorsal or <b>tubercular</b> portion and to the centrum
or to the ventral arch by a ventral or <b>capitular</b> portion.</p>

<p>In all animals above fishes the distal ends of the thoracic
ribs unite with a median breast bone or sternum which
generally has the form of a segmented rod. The <b>sternum</b> is
really formed by the fusion of the distal ends of a series of
ribs. In many animals elements of the shoulder girdle enter
into close relation with the rib elements of the sternum.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This consists of the skeleton of the anterior or <b>pectoral</b>,
and the posterior or <b>pelvic</b> limbs, and their girdles. In every
case (except in Chelonia) the parts of the appendicular skeleton
lie external to the ribs.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Limb girdles.</span></p>

<p><b>The Pectoral girdle</b><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. In the simplest case the pectoral
or shoulder girdle consists of a hoop of cartilage incomplete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dorsally. It is attached by muscle to the vertebral column,
and is divided on either side into dorsal and ventral portions
by a cavity, the <b>glenoid cavity</b>, at the point where the
anterior limb articulates. In higher fishes this hoop is distinctly
divided into right and left halves; it becomes more or
less ossified, and a pair of important bones, the clavicles, are
developed in connection with its ventral portion.</p>

<p>In higher vertebrates ossification sets up in the cartilage
and gives rise on each side to a dorsal bone, the <b>scapula</b>,
and frequently to an anterior ventral bone, the <b>precoracoid</b>,
and a posterior ventral bone, the <b>coracoid</b>. The precoracoid
is often not ossified, and upon it is developed the clavicle
which more or less replaces it. In some forms a <b>T</b> shaped
<i>interclavicle</i> occurs, in others <b>epicoracoids</b> are found in front
of the coracoids. In all vertebrata above fish, except the great
majority of mammals, the coracoids are large and articulate
with the sternum. But in mammals the coracoids are nearly
always quite vestigial, and the pectoral girdle is attached to
the axial skeleton by the clavicle or sometimes by muscles and
ligaments only.</p>

<p>The <b>Pelvic girdle</b><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> like the pectoral consists primitively
of a simple rod or hoop of cartilage, which in vertebrata above
fishes is divided into dorsal and ventral portions, by a cavity,
the <b>acetabulum</b>, with which the posterior limb articulates.
In the pelvic girdle as in the pectoral one dorsal, and (commonly)
two ventral ossifications take place. The dorsal bone
is the <b>ilium</b> and corresponds to the scapula. The posterior
ventral bone is the <b>ischium</b> corresponding to the coracoid.
The anterior ventral bone is the <b>pubis</b> and is generally compared
to the precoracoid, but in some cases a fourth pelvic
element, the <b>acetabular</b> or <b>cotyloid</b> bone is found, and this
may correspond to the precoracoid.</p>

<p>The pelvic girdle differs from the pectoral in the fact that
the dorsal bones&mdash;the ilia&mdash;are nearly always firmly united to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae, by means of
rudimentary ribs. The pubes and ischia generally meet in
ventral symphyses.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Limbs.</span></p>

<p>It will be most convenient to defer a discussion of the
limbs of fishes to chap. <span class="smcap">VIII</span>.</p>

<p>All vertebrates above fishes have the limbs divisible into
three main segments:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" width="80%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="center"><b>Anterior or Fore limb.</b>&nbsp;</td><td align="center"><b>Posterior or Hind limb.</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Proximal segment.</td><td align="center">upper arm or <i>brachium</i>.</td><td align="center">thigh.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Middle segment.</td><td align="center">fore-arm or <i>antibrachium</i>.</td><td align="center">shin or <i>crus</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Distal segment.</td><td align="center"><i>manus</i>.</td><td align="center"><i>pes</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The proximal segments each contain one bone, the <b>humerus</b>
in the case of the upper arm, and the <b>femur</b> in the case
of the thigh. The middle segments each contain two bones,
the <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b> in the case of the fore-arm, and the <b>tibia</b>
and <b>fibula</b> in the case of the shin.</p>

<p>The manus and pes are further subdivided into</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) two or three proximal rows of bones forming the
wrist or <b>carpus</b> in the case of the manus, and the ankle or
<b>tarsus</b> in the case of the pes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) a middle row called respectively the <b>metacarpus</b>
and <b>metatarsus</b>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) a number of distal bones called the <b>phalanges</b>
which form the skeleton of the fingers and toes, or <b>digits</b>.</p>

<p>Typically the manus and pes both have five digits (pentedactylate).
The first digit of the manus is commonly called
the <b>pollex</b>, and the first digit of the pes the <b>hallux</b>.</p>

<p>In a very simple <b>carpus</b> such as that of <i>Chelydra</i>, there
are nine bones. They are arranged in a proximal row of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
three, the radiale, intermedium, and ulnare,&mdash;the first being
on the radial side of the limb, and a distal row of five called
respectively carpale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, beginning on the radial side.
Between these two rows is a single bone the centrale, or there
may be two.</p>

<p>Similarly there are nine bones in a simple <b>tarsus</b> such as
that of <i>Salamandra</i>. They form a proximal row of three, the
tibiale, intermedium and fibulare, and a distal row of five,
called respectively tarsale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, beginning on the tibial
side. Between the two rows there is a centrale as in the
carpus, or there may be two.</p>

<p>The following names derived from human anatomy are
commonly applied to the various carpal and tarsal bones:</p>

<table border="0" width="80%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The above is the view commonly accepted concerning the
homology of the carpal and tarsal bones. But with regard to the
proximal row of tarsal bones there is difference of opinion. All anatomists
are agreed that the calcaneum is the fibulare and that the intermedium
is contained in the astragalus, but while the majority regard
the astragalus as the fused tibiale and intermedium, Baur considers
that a small bone found on the tibial side of the tarsus in <i>Procavia</i>,
many Rodents, Insectivores, and the male <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, is the vestigial
tibiale, and regards the astragalus as the intermedium alone<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. He
also considers that the mammalian scaphoid represents a centrale.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Modifications in the positions of the limbs</span><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>In their primitive position the limbs are straight and are
extended parallel to one another at right angles to the axis of
the trunk. Each limb then has a dorsal surface, a ventral
surface, an anterior or <b>pre-axial</b> edge, and a posterior or
<b>postaxial</b> edge.</p>

<p>In the anterior limb the radius and the pollex are pre-axial,
the ulna and the fifth finger are postaxial. In the
posterior limb the tibia and the hallux are pre-axial, the fibula
and the fifth toe are postaxial. The Cetacea and various extinct
reptiles, such as <i>Ichthyosaurus</i> and <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, have their
limbs in practically this primitive position.</p>

<p>The first modification from it is produced by the bending
ventrally of the middle segments of both limbs upon the
proximal segments, while the distal segment is bent in the
opposite direction on the middle segment. Then the ventral
surfaces of the antibrachium and crus come to look inwards,
and their dorsal surfaces to look outwards. The brachium
and manus, thigh and pes still have their dorsal surfaces
facing upwards and their ventral surfaces facing downwards
as before, and the relations of their pre- and postaxial borders
remain as they were. Many Amphibians and Reptiles, such
as tortoises, carry their limbs in this position.</p>

<p>In all higher vertebrates, however, a further change takes
place, each limb is rotated as a whole from its proximal end,
the rotation taking place in opposite directions in the fore and
hind limbs respectively. The anterior limb is rotated backwards
from the shoulder, so that the brachium lies nearly parallel
to the body, and the elbow points backwards, the antibrachium
downwards, and the manus backwards; the pre-axial surface of
the whole limb with the radius and pollex now faces outwards,
and the postaxial surface with the ulna and fifth finger now faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
inwards. In the Walrus and, to a certain extent, in the Sea lions
the anterior limb remains throughout life in this position.
The posterior limb is also rotated, but the rotation in this
case takes place forwards, so that the thigh lies nearly parallel
to the body, the knee-joint pointing forwards; the crus downwards
and the pes forwards. The pre-axial surface of the
whole limb with the tibia and hallux looks towards the middle
of the body, the postaxial surface with the fibula and fifth toe
looks outwards. This is the position in which the hind limb
is carried in nearly all mammals.</p>

<p>In nearly all mammals a further change takes place in the
position of the anterior limb. The radius and ulna have
hitherto been parallel to one another, but now the lower end
of the radius, carrying with it the manus, comes to be rotated
forwards round the ulna, so that the manus, as well as the
pes, comes to be forwardly-directed, and its pre-axial surface
faces inwards.</p>

<p>In the majority of mammals the radius and ulna are permanently
fixed in this, which is known as the <b>prone</b> position,
but in man and some other mammals the manus can be
pronated or turned into this position at will. When the
radius and ulna are parallel throughout their whole length
the manus is said to be in the <b>supine</b> position.</p>

<p>The <b>extensor</b> side of a limb is that to which the muscles
which straighten it are attached, the <b>flexor</b> side is that to
which the muscles which bend it are attached.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Palaeontological research has disclosed the existence of a great
number of forms which seem to connect with one another almost all the
orders of fishes as usually recognised. Forms connecting the living
Ganoids with the Teleosteans have been especially numerous, so that
these terms Ganoid and Teleostean can hardly be any longer used in a
precise and scientific sense. This has rendered the subject of the classification
of fishes a very difficult one. Though unsuitable for adoption in
a work like the present, by far the most natural classification hitherto
proposed seems to be that of Smith Woodward<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. He considers that the
course of development of fishes has followed two distinct lines, the autostylic
and hyostylic (see p. 119), and groups the various forms as follows:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>SKELETON OF HEMICHORDATA, UROCHORDATA,
AND CEPHALOCHORDATA.</small></h2>


<p class="cen">SUBPHYLUM A. HEMICHORDATA.</p>

<p>The subphylum includes three genera, <i>Balanoglossus</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, <i>Cephalodiscus</i>
and <i>Rhabdopleura</i>; and perhaps a fourth, <i>Phoronis</i>.</p>

<p>The skeletal structures found in <i>Balanoglossus</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> are all
endoskeletal. They include:</p>

<p>(1) The <b>notochord</b>. This arises as a diverticulum from
the alimentary canal which grows forwards into the proboscis
and extends beyond the front end of the central nervous
system. It is hypoblastic in origin and arises in the same way
as does the notochord of <i>Amphioxus</i>. Its cells become highly
vacuolated and take on the typical notochordal structure<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. The
cavity of the primitive diverticulum becomes obliterated in front,
but behind it opens throughout life into the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>(2) The <b>axial skeletal rods</b>. These are a pair of chitinous
rods which lie ventral to the notochord and in the collar
region unite to form a single mass.</p>

<p>(3) The <b>branchial skeleton</b>. The gill bars separating
the gill slits from one another are strengthened by chitinous
rods in a way closely similar to that in <i>Amphioxus</i>. But
between one primary forked rod and the next there are two
secondary unforked rods&mdash;not one, as in <i>Amphioxus</i>.</p>

<p>(4) The <b>chondroid tissue</b>. This is of mesoblastic origin
and may be regarded as an imperfect sheath for the notochord.</p>

<p>In <i>Cephalodiscus</i> and <i>Rhabdopleura</i> as in <i>Balanoglossus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the notochord forms a small diverticulum growing forwards
from the alimentary canal into the proboscis stalk.</p>

<p>Recent researches on <i>Phoronis</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> show the existence in the
collar region of the larva (<i>Actinotrocha</i>) of a paired organ,
which is regarded by its discoverer as representing a double
notochord.</p>


<p class="cen">SUBPHYLUM B. UROCHORDATA (<span class="smcap">Tunicata</span>).</p>

<p>Skeletal structures of epiblastic and hypoblastic origin
occur in the Urochordata. Most Tunicates are invested by
a thick gelatinous test which often contains calcareous spicules,
and serves as a supporting organ for the soft body. The cells
of this test are mesodermal in origin.</p>

<p>In larval Tunicata and in adults of the group Larvacea
the tail is supported by a typical notochord, which is confined
to the tail. In all Tunicata except Larvacea all trace of
the notochord is lost in the adult.</p>

<p>This subphylum includes the well-known genus <i>Amphioxus</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
In <i>Amphioxus</i> the skeleton is very simple. It contains no
trace of cartilage or bone and remains throughout life in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
condition corresponding to a very early stage in Vertebrata.
The skeleton of <i>Amphioxus</i> is partly hypoblastic, partly mesoblastic
in origin.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Hypoblastic skeleton.</b></p>

<p>The <b>notochord</b> (fig. 3, 2) is an elastic rod extending along
the whole length of the body past the anterior end of the
nerve cord. It lies ventral to the nerve cord, and shows no
trace of segmentation. It is chiefly made up of greatly vacuolated
cells containing lymph, but near the dorsal and ventral
surfaces the cells are less vacuolated. The notochord is immediately
surrounded by a structureless cuticular layer, the
<i>chordal sheath</i>, and outside this comes the mesoblastic <i>skeletogenous
layer</i>, which also surrounds the nerve cord.</p>

<p>The <b>branchial skeleton</b>. This consists of a series of
chitinous elastic rods which strengthen the gill bars and are
alternately forked and unforked ventrally. The forked rods
are primary, and are U-shaped in section, the unforked rods
are secondary, and are circular in section. All these rods are
united at intervals by transverse rods.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Mesoblastic skeleton.</b></p>

<p>The <b>buccal skeleton</b>. On each side of the mouth there
is a curved bar resembling the notochord in structure. The
bars are segmented, and each segment bears a smaller rod
which supports a tentacle, the whole forming the buccal
skeleton (fig. 3, 4).</p>

<p>The notochord is enclosed in a thick <b>sheath</b> of connective
tissue continuous with a thinner sheath round the nerve cord.
The sheaths of the notochord and nerve cord together form the
skeletogenous layer, and prolongations of it form the myomeres
or septa between the myotomes or segments of the great lateral
muscles of the body.</p>

<p>The <b>skeleton of each median fin</b> consists of small
cubical masses of a gelatinous substance arranged in rows
(fig. 3, 1 and 7), and serving to strengthen the fins.</p>

<small>SUBPHYLUM D. VERTEBRATA.</small></h2>


<p>The animals included in this great group all possess an
internal axial skeleton forming the vertebral column or back-bone;
and a dorsal spinal cord. The vertebral column is
developed from the skeletogenous layer, which surrounds the
spinal cord together with the notochord and its sheath; and
in the great majority of cases the notochord becomes more or
less modified and reduced in the adult. In some cases the
notochord remains unmodified and the skeletogenous layer
surrounding it is not segmented to form vertebrae, but in
every case the neural arches which protect the spinal cord
are segmented. The notochord never extends further forwards
than the mid-brain.</p>

<p>All true vertebrates possess a cranium or skeletal box
enclosing the brain.</p>


<p class="cen">(I.) <span class="smcap">Cyclostomata.</span></p>

<p>The mouth in living forms is suctorial and is not supported
by jaws. In some fossil forms the character of the mouth is
unknown.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order I.</i> <span class="smcap">Marsipobranchii</span><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>In these animals limbs and limb girdles are always completely
absent. They have no exoskeleton except horny teeth.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton, excluding the notochord, is entirely
cartilaginous or membranous. The axial skeleton consists of
a cartilaginous cranium without jaws, succeeded by a thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
persistent notochord enveloped in a sheath. The notochord
in living forms is unsegmented, but segmented cartilaginous
neural arches are present in some cases. A complicated series
of cartilaginous elements occurs in relation to the mouth, gills,
and sense organs. The median fins are supported by cartilaginous
pieces, the radiale. The order includes the Lampreys
and Hags.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order II.</i> <span class="smcap">Ostracodermi</span><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>The forms included in this group have long been extinct,
being known only from beds of Upper Silurian and Lower
Devonian age. They differ much from all other known animals.
The exoskeleton is always greatly developed and includes
(1) large bony plates covering the anterior region; (2) scales
covering the posterior region. The plates are deeply marked
by canals belonging to dermal sense organs. Jaws are unknown,
and arches for the support of the appendicular skeleton
are rudimentary or absent. The tail is heterocercal (see p. 60).</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Heterostraci.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton consists principally of calcifications forming
dorsal and ventral shields which cover the head and abdominal
region; the dorsal shield is formed of a few plates
firmly united, the ventral shield of a single plate. The shields
are composed of three layers, the middle layer being traversed
by canals belonging to the dermal sense organs which open to
the exterior by a series of pores. The tail is sometimes covered
by scales. The orbits are widely separated and laterally
placed. Paired appendages are absent. These curious forms
are found in beds of Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian age.
One of the best known genera is <i>Pteraspis</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Osteostraci.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton as in the Heterostraci consists of shields
and scales, the shields being divisible into three layers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
anterior part of the body is covered dorsally by a single large
shield which differs from those of the Heterostraci in having
the inner layer ossified. The middle layer contains canals for
the passage of blood vessels, but the exoskeleton shows no
impressions of dermal sense organs. The posterior part of the
body is covered by large quadrangular scales. Paired appendages
are absent, but median dorsal and caudal fins occur
supported by scales, not fin-rays. <i>Cephalaspis</i>, the best known
of these animals, occurs in beds of Lower Devonian age.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (3). <span class="smcap">Antiarcha.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton is formed of bony plates, the dorsal and
ventral shields each consisting of several symmetrically arranged
pieces. The tail may be covered with small scales or may be
naked. The head is articulated with the trunk, and its angles
are drawn out into a pair of segmented paddle-like appendages,
covered with dermal plates. The orbits are close together.
A dorsal fin and traces of mouth parts occur in <i>Pterichthys</i>,
but the endoskeleton is unknown. The best known forms
<i>Pterichthys</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and <i>Asterolepis</i> occur in beds of Lower Devonian
age.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">General account of the skeleton of</span></p>
<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Marsipobranchii</span>.</p>

<p>The Marsipobranchii are worm-like animals. The living
forms include two families, the Myxinoidei (Hags)&mdash;genera
<i>Myxine</i> and <i>Bdellostoma</i>&mdash;and the Petromyzontidae (Lampreys).</p>

<p>Three species of <i>Petromyzon</i> are known, <i>P. fluviatilis</i>, <i>P.
marinus</i> and <i>P. planeri</i>. The larval forms were for a long
time thought to belong to a separate genus and were called
<i>Ammocoetes</i>.</p>

<p>The Myxinoids, although very highly specialised in their
own way, are at distinctly a lower stage of development than
the adult Lamprey, and come nearer to the larval Lamprey or
Ammocoete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In Myxinoids and larval lampreys, the notochord is enclosed
in a thick chordal sheath, in connection with which in
the tail region there occur cartilaginous pieces forming neural
arch elements. In the trunk region, however, no cartilage
occurs in connection with the spinal column, the only cartilage
present being that forming the radiale of the dorsal fin. On
the other hand in most species of lamprey (<i>Petromyzon</i>)
cartilaginous pieces forming imperfect neural arches (fig. 4,
B, 13) are found lying in the tough skeletogenous layer dorsal
to the notochord, and extending throughout the whole length
of the trunk and tail. Two of these pieces, which are probably
homologous with the neural plates (see p. 72) of Elasmobranchs,
occur to each <i>neuromere</i>, or segment as determined by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
spinal nerves. The dorsal and caudal fins are supported by
paired cartilaginous radiale which are connected proximally
with the skeletogenous layer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>In Myxinoids the cranium is a mere cartilaginous floor
without side walls or roof, and the trabeculae<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> end without
growing forwards into cornua. In Lampreys the trabeculae
grow forwards and send up plates of cartilage which meet
above (fig. 4, 7) and form side walls and a roof for part of the
brain case. In Lampreys a labial suctorial apparatus is well
developed, including a large ring-like piece of cartilage (fig. 4, 2)
which supports the oral funnel and bears a large armament of
horny teeth. In Myxinoids on the other hand the labial
skeleton is small and consists merely of barbels round the
mouth.</p>

<p>The olfactory organ of Myxinoids has a very curious
skeleton. It is covered with a kind of grating of cartilage
which is prolonged in front into a tube composed of a series of
imperfect cartilaginous rings. In Lampreys the olfactory
organ opens merely by a short membranous passage. In
correlation with the small development of the labial suctorial
apparatus in Myxinoids the lingual apparatus is very greatly
developed. The tongue in <i>Myxine</i> has been said to 'dominate
the whole body' (Parker). It is supported by a great median
cartilaginous bar which when followed forwards first becomes
bifid and still further forwards becomes four-cleft.</p>

<p>The horny teeth in Myxinoids are chiefly borne on the
very large supralingual apparatus. They form a double series
arranged in the form of an arch. In <i>Myxine</i> there are seven
large teeth and nine small ones on each side. In <i>Bdellostoma</i>
the teeth of the two rows are more equal in size. In <i>Bdellostoma</i>
and <i>Myxine</i> it has been shown that imperfect calcified
teeth occur below the horny teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lampreys the lingual apparatus (fig. 4, C, 9) is well developed,
but not excessively so. It consists of a long median
cartilaginous bar which ends in front with a semicircular piece
of cartilage supporting the median part of the tongue.</p>

<p>In both Myxinoids and Lampreys there is a complicated
branchial basket apparatus, but while in Myxinoids the basket
apparatus is interbranchial, formed deep within the head
near the hypoblastic lining of the throat, in Lampreys it is
extra-branchial and formed outside the head cavities (fig.
4, 10). The two sides of the basket apparatus in <i>Myxine</i> are
not symmetrical. In the interbranchial basket apparatus of
Myxinoids the hyoid and first and second branchial arches
can be recognised. Traces of the interbranchial skeleton of
Myxinoids can be detected in Lampreys, and similarly in
Myxinoids, there are indications of the extra-branchial skeleton
of <i>Petromyzon</i>. The branchial basket in Lampreys forms at
its posterior end a kind of cup which supports the pericardium
(fig. 4, 11).</p>

<p>A remarkable Cyclostome named <i>Palaeospondylus</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> has recently
been described from the Scottish Old Red Sandstone.
It differs however from all living Cyclostomes, in having a
spinal column formed of distinct vertebrae with well-developed
neural arches. The caudal fin is well developed and the dorsal
radiale are forked as in lampreys. The skull is well calcified
and the auditory capsules are specially large. The mouth is
very similar to that of lampreys, being circular and without
jaws; it is provided with barbels or cirri. There is no trace
of limbs and the average length is only about 1-1&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>The mouth is supported by definite jaws.</p>


<p class="cen">ICHTHYOPSIDA.</p>

<p>The epiblastic exoskeleton is generally unimportant, the
mesoblastic exoskeleton is usually well developed.</p>

<p>The notochord with its membranous sheath (1) may remain
unmodified, or (2) may be replaced by bone or cartilage derived
from the skeletogenous layer, or (3) may be calcified to a
varying extent.</p>

<p>The first vertebra is not homologous throughout the whole
series and so is not strictly comparable to the atlas of Sauropsids
and Mammals.</p>

<p>The centra of the vertebrae have no epiphyses. The
skull may be (<i>a</i>) incomplete and membranous, or (<i>b</i>) more or
less cartilaginous, or (<i>c</i>) bony. Membrane bones are not
included in the cranial walls, and there are large unossified
tracts in the skull. When membrane bones are developed in
connection with the skull, a large parasphenoid occurs. The
basisphenoid is always small or absent. The skull may be
immovably fixed to the vertebral column, or may articulate
with it by a single or double occipital condyle. When the
occipital condyle is double, it is formed by the exoccipitals,
and the basi-occipital is small or unossified. The mandible
may be (<i>a</i>) cartilaginous, (<i>b</i>) partially ossified, or (<i>c</i>) membrane
bones may be developed in connection with it,&mdash;if so, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
usually more than one membrane bone developed in connection
with each half.</p>

<p>There are at least four pairs of branchial arches present
during development. The sternum, if present, is not costal
in origin.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Class I. Pisces.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton is in the form of scales, which may be
entirely mesoblastic or dermal in origin (e.g. <i>cycloid</i> and
<i>ctenoid</i> scales), or may be formed of both mesoblast and epiblast
(e.g. <i>placoid</i> and <i>ganoid</i> scales). Large bony plates may
be derived from both these types of scale. In general fish
with a greatly developed dermal armour have the endoskeleton
poorly developed; and the converse also holds good.</p>

<p>The integument of the dorsal and ventral surfaces is
commonly prolonged into longitudinal unpaired fins, supported
by an internal skeleton. These fins are distinguished
according to their position as dorsal, caudal and anal fins.
The dorsal and anal fins are used chiefly as directing organs,
the caudal fin is however a most important organ of propulsion.</p>

<p>Three types of tail are found in fishes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <b>diphycercal</b>, in which the axis is straight and
the tail is one-bladed and symmetrical, an equal proportion of
radiale<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> being attached to the upper and lower surfaces of the
axis.</p>

<p>2. The <b>heterocercal</b>, in which the tail is asymmetrical
and the axis is bent upwards, the proportion of radiale or of
fin-rays attached to its upper surface being much smaller than
that attached to its lower surface.</p>

<p>3. The <b>homocercal</b>, in which the tail though externally
symmetrical, so far resembling the diphycercal type, is
internally really heterocercal, the great majority of the radiale
or of the fin-rays being attached to the lower surface of the axis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The cranium in the simplest cases (e.g. Selachii) forms a
cartilaginous box enclosing the brain and sense organs; in
bony fishes it is greatly complicated. When palatine or
pterygoid bones are present they are formed by the ossification
of cartilage; in Sauropsida and Mammalia they are
laid down as membrane bones. There is no tympanic cavity
or auditory ossicle in relation to the ear.</p>

<p>There are two principal types of suspensorium by means of
which the jaws are attached to the cranium:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The <b>Autostylic</b>. This is the primitive condition
in which the mandibular arch articulates with the base of the
cranium in front of the hyoid and in a similar manner.</p>

<p>(2) The <b>Hyostylic</b>. In this case the mandibular arch
becomes connected with the hyomandibular and supported by
the hyoid arch. These terms are more fully discussed in
Chapter VIII.</p>

<p>There is always an internal framework supporting the
gills; it usually consists of the hyoid arch and five, rarely
six or seven, pairs of branchial arches. The limbs are represented
by two pairs of fins, the pectoral and the pelvic; they
are not divided into proximal, middle and distal portions. The
ribs do not unite with a median ventral sternum, or meet in
the mid-ventral line in any other way in the trunk region.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order I.</i> <span class="smcap">Elasmobranchii.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton is in the form of placoid scales which are
sometimes so numerous as to give the whole skin a rough
surface forming shagreen. In some cases the placoid scales
are enlarged to form plates or spines capped or coated with
enamel. These spines may be imbedded in the flesh in front
of the paired or unpaired fins, or may be attached to the tail.
They are specially characteristic of the suborder Acanthodii.
The endoskeleton is cartilaginous and true bone is never
found. Much of the skeleton, especially of the vertebral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
column, is however often calcified, this being especially well
seen in the anterior part of the vertebral column of Rays
(Raiidae). In living forms cartilaginous biconcave vertebrae
are always well developed, but in some extinct forms the
notochord persists unconstricted. Neural and haemal arches
are however always developed; they sometimes remain
separate, sometimes fuse with the centra. Ribs are often
wanting and when present are often not separated off from the
vertebrae. The cranium is a simple cartilaginous box whose
most prominent parts are the capsules which enclose the
sense organs. The skull is sometimes immovably fixed to
the vertebral column, sometimes articulates with it by means
of two condyles. There is no operculum and no representative
of the maxilla or premaxillae. The teeth are very variable.
Large pectoral and pelvic fins always occur.</p>

<p>The Elasmobranchii may be divided into four suborders:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Ichthyotomi.</p>
<p>(2) Pleuropterygii.</p>
<p>(3) Selachii.</p>
<p>(4) Acanthodii.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Ichthyotomi</span><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>The members of this suborder range from the Devonian to
the Permian and so have long been extinct.</p>

<p>The endoskeletal cartilage has granular calcifications evenly
distributed throughout it. The notochord is unconstricted, but
the neural and haemal arches are well-developed, and the
neural spines are long and slender. There is a continuous
dorsal fin with separate basalia and radiale. The tail is diphycercal,
and the pectoral fins are typical archipterygia<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.
The pelvic fins of the male are prolonged to form claspers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The best known of these primitive Elasmobranchs are the
Pleuracanthidae.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Pleuropterygii.</span></p>

<p>This suborder was formed for the reception of <i>Cladoselache</i>,
an Elasmobranch found in the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is in the form of small, thickly-studded
dermal denticles. The vertebral centra are unossified, and
the tail is strongly heterocercal. There were certainly five,
perhaps seven gill slits, and the suspensorium is apparently
hyostylic. The paired fins are, according to the view which
derives them by concentration from continuous lateral folds,
the most primitive known (see p. 129) and claspers are
absent.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (3). <span class="smcap">Selachii.</span></p>

<p>Cartilaginous or partially calcified biconcave vertebrae are
always well developed; they constrict the notochord intervertebrally.
The neural and haemal arches and spines are
stout and intercalary cartilages (interdorsalia) are present.
The tail is heterocercal, but in some cases (<i>Squatina</i>) approaches
the diphycercal condition. In most cases the suspensorium
is hyostylic, the jaws being attached to the cranium
by means of the hyomandibular, and the palato-pterygo-quadrate
bar not being fused to the cranium. There are
generally five pairs of branchial arches, and gill rays are
borne on the posterior surface of the hyoid arch, and on both
the anterior and posterior surfaces of the first four branchial
arches. The Notidanidae differ from most Selachians in two
respects, first as regards the suspensorium,&mdash;Meckel's cartilage
articulating directly with the palato-pterygo-quadrate bar, and
not being connected with the hyoid arch; and secondly as
regards the number of branchial arches,&mdash;six pairs occurring
in <i>Hexanchus</i> and seven in <i>Heptanchus</i>.</p>

<p>The pectoral fins are without the segmented axis of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
archipterygium. In most cases they are sharply marked off
from the body and lie almost at right angles to it; but in the
Rays they have the form of lateral expansions in the same
plane as the body, from which they are not sharply marked
off. The pelvic fins in the male bear long grooved cartilaginous
rods which are accessory copulatory organs or claspers.</p>

<p>There are two principal groups of Selachii, the Squalidae
or Sharks and Dogfish, and the Batoidei or Skates and Rays.
The Squalidae have the shape of ordinary fish, the pectoral
fins are vertically placed and the body ends in a powerful
heterocercal tail. The Batoidei have flattened bodies owing
to the great size and horizontal position of the pectoral fins.
The tail is long and thin and is often armed with spines.
The teeth in Selachii differ much in character in the different
forms, and are always arranged in numerous rows. They are
generally pointed and triangular or conical in the Squalidae,
while in the Batoidei they are often broad and flattened.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (4). <span class="smcap">Acanthodii.</span></p>

<p>The fishes included in this group are all extinct and
in some respects are intermediate between Elasmobranchii
and Ganoidei. The body is elongated and closely covered
with small scales consisting of dentine enamelled at the surface.
The notochord is persistent and the calcification of the
endoskeletal cartilage is only superficial. The tail is heterocercal.
The jaws bear small conical teeth, or in some cases
are toothless. The skeleton of all the fins differs from that of
modern Elasmobranchs in having the cartilaginous radiale
much reduced, and the fins are nearly always each provided
with an anterior spine, which except in the case of the pectoral
fins is merely inserted between the muscles. These spines
are really enormous dermal fin-rays; the pectoral fin-spine is
articulated to the pectoral girdle.</p>

<p>The suborder includes many well-known extinct forms like
<i>Acanthodes</i> and <i>Diplacanthus</i>; it ranges from the Devonian to
the Permian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>These singular fish have the skin smooth and in living
forms almost or quite scaleless. The palato-pterygo-quadrate
bar and hyomandibular are fused to the cranium, and Meckel's
cartilage articulates directly with the part corresponding to the
quadrate. The skull is distinctly articulated with the spinal
column, the notochord is persistent and unconstricted, and the
skeletogenous layer shows no trace of metameric segmentation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
though in the neural arches this segmentation is readily traceable.
The neural arches of the first few vertebrae are fused
together and completely surround the notochord, while they
do not in other parts of the body. The tail is diphycercal.
Of the living genera, in <i>Callorhynchus</i> there is no trace of
calcification in the skeletogenous layer, while in <i>Chimaera</i> rings
of calcification are found, there being three to five for each
vertebra as indicated by the foramina for the exit of the spinal
nerves. The pelvic fins are produced into claspers. Besides
the living genera <i>Chimaera</i>, <i>Harriotta</i> and <i>Callorhynchus</i> a
fair number of fossil forms are known, e.g. <i>Ischyodus</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> III. <span class="smcap">Ganoidei.</span></p>

<p>The fishes included under the term Ganoidei form a very
heterogeneous group, some of which closely approach the Dipnoi,
others the Elasmobranchii, others the Teleostei. The great
majority of them are extinct, only eight living genera being
known; these are all inhabitants of the northern hemisphere,
and with the exception of <i>Acipenser</i>, which is both fluviatile
and marine, are entirely confined to fresh water.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is very variable, thus the body may be:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Naked or with minute stellate ossifications as in
the Polyodontidae. (<i>b</i>) Partially covered with large detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
bony plates as in <i>Scaphirhynchus</i> and <i>Acipenser</i>. (<i>c</i>) Entirely
covered with rhomboidal ganoid scales as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>,
<i>Polypterus</i>, <i>Palaeoniscus</i> and many extinct forms. (<i>d</i>) Covered
with rounded scales shaped like the cycloid scales of Teleosteans
as in <i>Amia</i>. (<i>e</i>) Having the trunk and part of the tail covered
with rhomboidal scales, and the remainder of the tail with
rounded scales as in <i>Trissolepis</i>.</p>

<p>The teeth also are very variable. The endoskeleton shows
every stage of transition from an almost entirely cartilaginous
state as in <i>Acipenser</i> to a purely bony state as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>.
Sometimes, as in <i>Acipenser</i>, the notochord persists, and its
sheath is unsegmented; sometimes, as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>, there
are fully formed vertebrae. The tail may be heterocercal, as
in <i>Acipenser</i>, or diphycercal as in <i>Polypterus</i>. The cartilaginous
cranium is always covered with external membrane
bone to a greater or less extent, and the suspensorium is
markedly hyostylic. The pectoral girdle is formed of two
parts, one endoskeletal and cartilaginous, corresponding with
the pectoral girdle of Elasmobranchs, and one exoskeletal
and formed of membrane bones, corresponding with the clavicular
bones of Teleosteans. The pelvic fins are always
abdominal. The fins often, as in <i>Polypterus</i>, have spines
(fulcra) attached to their anterior borders.</p>

<p>The order Ganoidei may be divided into three suborders:</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) <span class="smcap">Chondrostei.</span> Living genera <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>,
<i>Polyodon</i> and <i>Psephurus</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">Crossopterygii.</span> Living genera <i>Polypterus</i> and
<i>Calamoichthys</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <span class="smcap">Holostei.</span> Living genera <i>Lepidosteus</i> and <i>Amia</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Chondrostei.</span></p>

<p>The skull is immovably fixed to the vertebral column.
By far the greater part of the skeleton is cartilaginous.
The notochord is persistent and unconstricted, its sheath is
membranous, but cartilaginous neural and haemal arches are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
developed. Intercalary pieces (interdorsalia) occur between
the neural arches, and similar pieces (interventralia) between
the haemal arches. The cranium is covered with membrane
bone, and teeth are but slightly developed. The tail is heterocercal.
Gill rays occur on the hyoid arch, and the gills are
protected by a bony operculum attached to the hyomandibular.
The skin (1) may be almost or quite naked, (2) may
carry bony plates arranged in rows, or may be covered (3) with
rhomboidal scales, or (4) partly with rhomboidal, partly with
cycloidal scales.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Crossopterygii.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton has the form of cycloidal or rhomboidal
scales. The condition of the vertebral column differs in the
different genera. Sometimes, as in <i>Polypterus</i>, there are well-developed
ossified vertebrae; sometimes, as in many extinct
forms, the notochord persists and is unconstricted. The tail
may be diphycercal or heterocercal. The pectoral and sometimes
the pelvic fins consist of an endoskeletal axis bearing
a fringe of dermal rays.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (3). <span class="smcap">Holostei.</span></p>

<p>The exoskeleton has the form of cycloidal or rhomboidal
scales. The notochord is constricted and its sheath is segmented
and ossified, forming distinct vertebrae, which are
generally biconcave, sometimes opisthocoelous (<i>Lepidosteus</i>).
The cartilaginous cranium is largely replaced by bone, and in
connection with it we find not only membrane bone, but
cartilage bone, as the basi-occipital, exoccipitals, and pro-otic
are ossified. The tail is heterocercal. The suspensorium
resembles that of Teleosteans, consisting of a proximal ossification,
the hyomandibular, which is movably articulated to
the skull and a distal ossification, the symplectic. The two
are separated by some unossified cartilage. The cartilaginous
upper and lower jaws are to a great extent surrounded and
replaced by a series of membrane bones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> IV. <span class="smcap">Teleostei</span>.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is sometimes absent but generally consists
of overlapping cycloid or ctenoid scales. Bony plates are sometimes
present, as in the Siluridae, or the body may be encased
in a complete armour of calcified plates, as in <i>Ostracion</i>.
Enamel is however never present, and the plates are entirely
mesodermal. The skeleton is bony, but in the skull much
cartilage generally remains. The vertebral centra are usually
deeply biconcave, and the tail is of the masked heterocercal
type distinguished as <i>homocercal</i>. In the skull the occipital
region is always completely ossified, while the sphenoidal
region is generally less ossified. The skull has usually
a very large number of membrane bones developed in connection
with it. The teeth vary much in character in the different
members of the order, but are as a rule numerous and pointed,
and are ankylosed to the bone. The suspensorium is hyostylic
and the jaws have much the same arrangement as in
the Holostei. There are five pairs of branchial arches, of
which all except the last bear gill rays. A series of dermal
opercular bones is developed in connection with these arches.
The pectoral girdle consists almost entirely of dermal clavicular
bones. The pelvic girdle has disappeared, its place being taken
by the enlarged and ossified dermal fin-rays of the pelvic fins.</p>

<p>The group includes the vast majority of living fish (see
p. 33).</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> V. <span class="smcap">Dipnoi</span>.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is of two types; dermal bones are largely
developed in the head region, while the tail and posterior
part of the body may be naked or may be covered with overlapping
scales. The cranium remains chiefly cartilaginous,
the palato-pterygo-quadrate bar is fused with the cranium,
and the suspensorium is autostylic. The gill clefts are feebly
developed and open into a cavity covered by an operculum.
The notochord is persistent and unconstricted, and the limbs
are archipterygia. The pelvic fins are without claspers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Sirenoidei</span><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>The head has well developed membrane bones. The trunk
is covered with overlapping scales and bears no bony plates.
Three pairs of teeth are present, two in the upper and one
in the lower jaw, the two principal pairs of teeth are borne on
the palato-pterygoids and splenials, while the third pair are
found in the vomerine region. The tail is diphycercal in
living forms. In the extinct Dipteridae it is heterocercal.
The pectoral girdle includes both membrane and cartilage
bones. The pelvic girdle consists of a single bilaterally
symmetrical piece of cartilage.</p>

<p>This suborder is represented by the living genera <i>Ceratodus</i>,
<i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Lepidosiren</i>, and among extinct forms by the
Dipteridae and others.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Arthrodira</span>.</p>

<p>Bony plates are developed not only on the head but also
on the anterior part of the trunk, where they consist of a
dorsal, a ventral, and a pair of lateral plates which articulate
with the cranial shield. The posterior part of the trunk is
naked. The tail is diphycercal. The jaws are shear-like, and
their margins are usually provided with pointed teeth whose
bases fuse with the tissue of the jaw and constitute dental
plates. There seem to have been three pairs of these plates,
arranged as in the Sirenoidei, the principal ones in the upper
jaw being borne on the palato-pterygoids. Small pelvic fins
are present, but pectoral fins are unknown.</p>

<p>The Arthrodira occur chiefly in beds of Devonian and
Carboniferous age. Two of the best known genera are
<i>Coccosteus</i> from the European Devonian and <i>Dinichthys</i>, a
large predatory form from the lower Carboniferous of Ohio.</p>

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE
DOGFISH<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</small></h2>

<p class="cen"><i>Scyllium canicula.</i></p>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton of the dogfish is mainly composed of placoid
scales, each of which consists of a little bony base imbedded
in the skin, bearing a small backwardly-directed spine formed
of dentine capped with enamel. The scales are larger on
the dorsal than on the ventral surface, and on the jaws they
are specially large and regularly arranged in rows, there
forming the teeth. The margins of the jaws or lips are without
scales.</p>

<p>A second exoskeletal structure is found in the fins, all
of which, both paired and unpaired, have, in addition to their
cartilaginous endoskeleton, large numbers of long slender
horny fibres, the fin-rays, which are of exoskeletal origin.</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton of the dogfish consists almost entirely
of cartilage, which however may become calcified in places,
e.g. the centrum of each vertebra is lined by a layer of calcified
tissue.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton is divisible into an <b>axial</b> portion consisting
of the vertebral column, skull, and skeleton of the
median fins, and an <b>appendicular</b> portion consisting of the
skeleton of the paired fins and their girdles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral Column and Ribs.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral column consists of a series of some hundred
and thirty vertebrae, each of which is united with its predecessor
and successor in such a way as to allow a large
amount of flexibility.</p>

<p>These vertebrae are developed round an unsegmented
rod, the <b>notochord</b>, which forms the axial support of the
embryo. The notochord remains continuous throughout the
whole vertebral column, but is greatly constricted opposite the
middle of each vertebra, and thus rendered moniliform. The
vertebrae are divided into two groups, an anterior group of
trunk vertebrae, and a posterior group of caudal or tail
vertebrae.</p>

<p>A typical vertebra consists of a middle portion, the <b>centrum</b>,
a dorsal portion, the <b>dorsal</b> or <b>neural arch</b>, which
surrounds the spinal cord, and a ventral portion, the <b>ventral</b>
or <b>haemal arch</b>, which similarly encloses a space.</p>

<p>The tail vertebrae of the dogfish have this typical arrangement,
the trunk vertebrae have the haemal arches modified.</p>

<p>Each <b>centrum</b> is a short cylinder of cartilage surrounding
an hourglass-shaped cavity occupied by the notochord. The
<b>neural arches</b> are composed of three separate elements, the
<b>vertebral neural plates</b> (basidorsalia), <b>intervertebral
neural plates</b> (interdorsalia), and <b>neural spines</b> (supradorsalia).</p>

<p>The <b>vertebral neural plates</b> are in the adult fused with
their respective centra, and are notched behind for the exit
of the ventral (motor) roots of the spinal nerves. The <b>intervertebral
neural plates</b> are polygonal pieces alternating
with the vertebral neural plates; they are notched behind,
but at a more dorsal level than are the vertebral neural plates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
for the exit of the dorsal or sensory roots of the spinal
nerves.</p>

<p>The <b>neural spines</b> are small patches of cartilage filling
up the gaps between the dorsal ends of the neural plates.</p>

<p>The <b>haemal arches</b> (basiventralia) differ much in the
trunk and tail portions of the vertebral column. In the
trunk portion the centra are flattened below, and the two
halves of the haemal arch diverge from one another as blunt
<b>ventri-lateral processes</b> to which short cartilaginous rods,
the <b>ribs</b>, are attached. Further back at about vertebra 37,
the two halves of the haemal arch project downwards and
meet forming a complete arch. Further back still, towards
the hind end of the tail, the haemal arches bear median
<b>haemal spines</b> (ventrispinalia).</p>


<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>The skull of the dogfish remains cartilaginous throughout
the life of the animal, and has consequently a far more simple
structure than have the skulls of higher animals, in which
complication has been produced by the development of bone.</p>

<p>The skull consists of the following parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) a dorsal portion, the <b>cranium</b>, which lodges the brain,
and to the sides of which the capsules of the auditory and
olfactory sense organs are united. The cranium may be
compared to an unsegmented continuation of the vertebral
column;</p>

<p>(2) a number of ventral structures, disconnected or only
loosely connected with the cranium. These together constitute
the <b>visceral skeleton</b> forming the jaws and supporting
the gills.</p>

<p>(1) <span class="smcap">The Cranium.</span></p>

<p>The <b>Cranium</b> is an oblong box, with a flattened floor and
a more irregular roof. Its sides are expanded in front owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the olfactory capsules, and behind owing to the auditory
capsules, while in the middle they are deeply hollowed to form
the orbits.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) On the dorsal surface of the cranium the following
points should be noticed. First at the anterior end, the large
thin-walled <b>nasal</b> or <b>olfactory capsules</b> (fig. 6, 1), each of
which is drawn out into a narrow cartilaginous process.</p>

<p>The olfactory capsules have no ventral walls, and are
separated from one another by the <b>internasal septum</b>, which
is drawn out into a third slender process. These three processes
together constitute the <b>rostrum</b> (fig. 6, 2).</p>

<p>Behind the olfactory capsules comes a large, nearly circular,
hole, the <b>anterior fontanelle</b>, slightly behind which are the
two <b>ophthalmic foramina</b>. The dorsal and ventral boundaries
of the orbits are respectively formed by the prominent
<b>supra-orbital</b> and <b>suborbital ridges</b>. Behind are the <b>auditory
capsules</b> (fig. 6, 8), each of which is marked by a pair
of prominent ridges, converging towards the middle line to a
pair of apertures. These apertures communicate with two
canals, the <b>aqueductus vestibuli</b>, which lead into the internal
ear. The two ridges lodge respectively the <b>anterior
and posterior vertical semicircular canals</b> of the ear.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The principal structures to be noted in a side view of
the cranium are contained in the <b>orbit</b> or eye-cavity. Near the
base of the orbit at its anterior end is seen the small <b>orbitonasal
foramen</b> (fig. 6, 7), for the passage of blood-vessels,
not nerves. Above it is the large <b>ophthalmic foramen</b>
(fig. 6, 5) so prominent in a dorsal view of the skull; through
it the ophthalmic branches of the fifth and seventh nerves
pass. Slightly further back near the ventral surface is
the large <b>optic foramen</b> (fig. 6, II.) for the passage of the
second nerve. Vertically above the optic foramen, near the
dorsal surface, is the very small <b>foramen for the fourth
nerve</b> (fig. 6, IV.). Behind and a little above the optic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
foramen is another small aperture, the <b>foramen for the
third nerve</b>. Behind and slightly below this is the large
<b>foramen for the sixth and main branches of the fifth
and seventh nerves</b> (fig. 6, V.). In front of and slightly
below this foramen are seen two other small apertures; the
more anterior and ventral of these (fig. 6, 4) is for the
passage of a vessel connecting the efferent artery of the hyoid
gill with the internal carotid artery inside the skull, the more
posterior and dorsal is for the <b>interorbital canal</b> (fig. 6, 3)
which unites the two orbital sinuses. Above and very slightly
in front of the large foramen for the sixth and main parts
of the fifth and seventh nerves, are two small foramina
(fig. 6, Va., and VIIa.), through which the <b>ophthalmic
branches of the fifth and seventh nerves</b> enter the
orbit. Behind and slightly below the large foramen just
mentioned is a small hole through which the external carotid
enters the orbit (fig. 6, 9).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

</table></div></div>

<p>Behind the orbit is the <b>auditory capsule</b>. This is
marked below by a prominent <b>surface for the articulation
of the hyomandibular</b>, above which is the deep <b>postorbital
groove</b> for the passage of a blood-vessel, connecting
the orbital and anterior cardinal sinuses.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Passing to the posterior end of the cranium: in the
centre is seen the large <b>foramen magnum</b> through which
the brain and spinal cord communicate. The <b>notochord</b>
enters the skull just below this foramen, and on each side of
the notochord is a projection, the <b>occipital condyle</b>, by
which the first vertebra articulates with the skull.</p>

<p>External to the condyles are the prominent <b>pneumogastric
foramina</b> for the passage of the tenth nerves, and
further to the sides, just beyond the posterior vertical semicircular
canals, are a pair of deep pits in which lie the
<b>foramina for the ninth nerves</b> (fig. 6, IX).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The broad and flat ventral surface of the cranium is
continued in front as the <b>internasal septum</b> and terminated
laterally by the <b>suborbital ridges</b>. At a little behind the
middle it is traversed by two shallow grooves along which
the internal carotid arteries run. At the divergent ends of
these grooves are seen two small apertures through which the
external carotids enter the orbit (fig. 6, 9), and at the point
where they meet is a single small aperture through which the
internal carotid enters the cranium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">The Visceral Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>The <b>Visceral skeleton</b> forms a series of seven cartilaginous
arches or hoops, surrounding the anterior part of the
alimentary canal, and enclosing a wide but rather shallow
space.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The first or <b>mandibular arch</b> is the largest of the
series, and forms the upper and lower jaws. Each half of the
upper jaw or <b>palato-pterygo-quadrate</b> bar is formed by a
thick cartilaginous rod which meets its fellow in the middle
line in front, the two being united by ligament. Each half is
connected to the cranium just in front of the orbit by the
<b>ethmo-palatine ligament</b> (fig. 6, 10), and at its hind end
articulates with one of the halves of the lower jaw. Each
half of the lower jaw or <b>Meckel's cartilage</b> (fig. 6, 12) is
a cartilaginous bar, wide behind but narrow in front, where
it is united to its fellow by a median ligament. Imbedded
in the tissue external to the upper jaw are a pair of
<b>labial cartilages</b>, and a similar but smaller pair are
imbedded in the tissue external to the lower jaw.</p>

<p>The jaws are developed from a structure whose dorsal and
ventral portions subsequently become of very different importance.
The ventral portion forms both upper and lower jaws,
the former being developed as an outgrowth from the latter.
The dorsal portion forms only the <b>pre-spiracular ligament</b>
(fig. 6, 20), a strong fibrous band containing a nodule of
cartilage, and running from the anterior part of the auditory
capsule to the point where the jaws are connected with the
hyomandibular.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <b>hyoid arch</b> consists of a pair of cartilaginous
rods which are attached at their dorsal ends to the cranium,
and are united ventrally by a broad median plate of cartilage,
the <b>basi-hyal</b>. Each rod is divided into a dorsal portion,
the <b>hyomandibular</b> and a ventral portion, the <b>cerato-hyal</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The <b>hyomandibular</b> (fig. 6, 13) is a short stout rod of cartilage
projecting outwards, and somewhat backwards and downwards
from the cranium, with which it articulates behind the orbit
and below the postorbital groove. Its distal end articulates
with a rather long slender bar, the <b>cerato-hyal</b> (fig. 6, 14),
which is in its turn attached to the side of the <b>basi-hyal</b>. The
<b>basi-hyal</b> is a broad plate, rounded in front and drawn out
behind into two processes to which the two halves of the
first branchial arch are attached. The posterior surfaces of
both hyomandibular and cerato-hyal bear slender cartilaginous
processes, the <b>gill rays</b>. The hyoid arch forms the main
<b>suspensorium</b> or means by which the jaws are attached to
the cranium. This attachment is chiefly brought about by
a series of short ligaments which connect the posterior ends
of both upper and lower jaws with the hyomandibular, but
there is also a ligament connecting the lower jaw with the
cerato-hyal. The attachment of the jaws to the cranium is
also partially effected by the pre-spiracular and ethmo-palatine
ligaments.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Each of the five <b>branchial arches</b> is a hoop, incomplete
above and formed of four or more pieces of cartilage.
The most dorsal elements, the <b>pharyngo-branchials</b>, are
flattened, pointed plates whose free inner ends run obliquely
backwards, and terminate below the vertebral column. They
are connected at their outer ends with the short broad <b>epi-branchials</b>
(fig. 6, 16) which lie at the sides of the pharynx.
From the epi-branchials arise the long <b>cerato-branchials</b>
(fig. 6, 17) which run forwards and inwards along the ventral
wall of the pharynx. The first four cerato-branchials are
connected with small rods, the <b>hypo-branchials</b>, which run
backwards to meet one another in the middle line. The last
two pairs of hypo-branchials and the fifth cerato-branchials
are connected with a broad median plate, the <b>basibranchial</b>.
Along the outer sides of the second, third and fourth cerato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>-branchials
are found elongated curved rods, the <b>extra-branchials</b>
(fig. 6, 19). The epi-branchials and cerato-branchials
bear gill rays along their posterior borders.</p>


<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Skeleton of the Median Fins.</span></p>

<p>The <b>dorsal fins</b> have a skeleton consisting of a series of
short cartilaginous rods, the <b>basals</b> or basalia, which slope
obliquely backwards. Their bases are imbedded in the
muscles of the back, while their free ends bear a number
of small polygonal cartilaginous plates, the <b>radials</b> or radiale.
Associated with this cartilaginous skeleton are a number of
long slender horny fibres, the fin-rays, which have been already
referred to in connection with the exoskeleton. The skeleton
of the other median fins mainly consists of these fibres, the
cartilaginous portion being reduced or absent.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This includes the skeleton of the two pairs of limbs and of
their respective girdles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral girdle</span> forms a crescent-shaped hoop of
cartilage, incomplete above and lying just behind the visceral
skeleton. The mid-ventral part of the hoop is the thinnest
portion, and is drawn out in front into a short rounded process
which is cupped dorsally and supports part of the floor of the
pericardium (fig. 7, 1). On each side of this flattened mid-ventral
portion the arch becomes very thick and bears on its
outer border a surface with which the three basal cartilages
of the fin articulate. The dorsal ends or scapular portions
of the girdle form a pair of gradually tapering horns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral fin</span> articulates with the pectoral girdle by
means of three basalia or basal cartilages, the <b>propterygium</b>,
<b>meso-pterygium</b> and <b>meta-pterygium</b>. The most anterior
and the smallest of these is the <b>propterygium</b> (fig. 7, 5),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
while the most posterior one, the <b>meta-pterygium</b> (fig. 7, 3),
is much the largest. Along the outer borders of the three
basalia are arranged a series of close set cartilaginous pieces,
the <b>radiale</b>. The propterygium supports only a single radial,
which is however much larger than any of the others. The
meso-pterygium also supports only a single radial which divides
distally.</p>

<p>The meta-pterygium bears about twelve long narrow
radials, the first nine of which are traversed by a transverse
joint at about two-thirds of the way from their origin. Succeeding
the radials are a series of small polygonal pieces of
cartilage arranged in one or more rows and attached to the ends
of the radials, and finally the fin is completed by the dermal
fin-rays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle</span> is much smaller than the pectoral.
It is formed of a stout nearly straight bar of cartilage placed
transversely across the ventral region of the body. The bar
has no dorsal or lateral extensions, and is terminated by short
blunt processes. It bears on its posterior surface a pair of
facets with which the pelvic fins articulate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Fin</span> is smaller and more simply constructed

rod, the <b>basi-pterygium</b> (fig. 8, 2), running directly backwards
on the inner side of the fin, and articulating in front with the
pelvic girdle. From its outer side arise a series of about
fourteen parallel cartilaginous radials which bear smaller
polygonal pieces. The anterior one or two of these radials may
articulate independently with the pelvic girdle. In the adult
male dogfish the distal end of the basi-pterygium bears a stout
rod nearly as long as itself, and grooved on the dorsal surface.
This is the skeleton of the <b>clasper</b> (fig. 8, 3).</p>

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE
CODFISH.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
(<i>Gadus morrhua.</i>)</small></h2>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton includes</p>

<p>(1) <b>Scales.</b> These are of the type known as <b>cycloid</b>
and consist of flat rounded plates composed of concentrically
arranged laminae of calcified matter, with the posterior margin
entire. The anterior end of each scale is imbedded in the skin
and is overlapped by the preceding scales.</p>

<p>(2) The <b>teeth</b>. These are small, pointed, calcified structures
arranged in large groups on the premaxillae, mandible,
vomer, and superior and inferior pharyngeal bones.</p>

<p>(3) The <b>fin-rays</b>. These are delicate, nearly straight
bony rods which support the fins.</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton of the Codfish, though partially cartilaginous,
is mainly ossified.</p>

<p>It is divisible into an <b>axial portion</b>, including the skull,
vertebral column, ribs, and skeleton of the median fins, and
an <b>appendicular portion</b>, including the skeleton of the
paired fins and their girdles.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral Column.</span></p>

<p>This consists of a series of some fifty-two vertebrae, all completely
ossified.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>It is divisible into two regions only, viz. the <b>trunk</b> region,
the vertebrae of which bear movable ribs, and the <b>caudal</b> or
<b>tail</b> region, the vertebrae of which do not bear movable ribs.</p>

<p><b>Trunk vertebrae.</b></p>

<p>These are seventeen in number; the ninth may be described
as typical of them all. It consists of a short deeply
biconcave <b>centrum</b> whose two cavities communicate by a
narrow central canal. From the dorsal surface of the anterior
half of the centrum arise two strong plates, the dorsal or
<b>neural processes</b>, which are directed obliquely backwards
and meet forming the dorsal or <b>neural arch</b>. This is produced
into a long backwardly-directed dorsal or <b>neural
spine</b>.</p>

<p>From the lower part of the anterior edge of each neural
arch arise a pair of blunt triangular projections which overhang
the posterior half of the preceding centrum, and bear a
pair of flattened surfaces which correspond to the anterior
or <b>prezygapophyses</b> of most vertebrae, they differ however
from ordinary prezygapophyses in the fact that they look
downwards and outwards. From the posterior end of the
centrum arise a pair of short blunt processes each of which
bears an upwardly- and inwardly-directed articulating surface
corresponding to a <b>postzygapophysis</b>.</p>

<p>The two halves of the ventral arch form a pair of large
<b>ventri-lateral processes</b> which arise from the anterior half
of the centrum and pass outwards and slightly backwards and
downwards.</p>

<p>Behind these there arises on each vertebra a second outgrowth
which is small and flattened, and like the ventri-lateral
process serves to protect the air-bladder. The surface
of the centrum is marked by more or less wedge-shaped depressions,
one in the mid-dorsal line, and two on the ventral
surface immediately mesiad to the bases of the ventri-lateral
process. There are also a number of smaller depressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The space between one centrum and the next is in the fresh
skeleton filled up by the gelatinous remains of the <b>notochord</b>.</p>

<p>The first few vertebrae differ from the others in having
very short centra and no ventri-lateral processes.</p>

<p>The first vertebra comes into very close relation to the
posterior part of the skull, articulating with the exoccipitals.
In the next few vertebrae the centra gradually lengthen,
and at the fourth or fifth vertebra the ventri-lateral processes
appear and gradually increase in size as followed back.
They likewise gradually come to arise at a lower level on the
centrum, and also become more and more downwardly directed,
till at the last trunk vertebra they nearly meet.</p>

<p>The <b>neural spines</b> of the anterior trunk vertebrae are
much longer than those of the posterior ones, that of the first
vertebra being the largest and longest of all, and articulating
with the skull. The spinal nerves pass out through wide
notches or spaces between the successive neural arches.</p>

<p><b>Caudal vertebrae.</b></p>

<p>The caudal vertebrae are about thirty-five in number,
each consists of a centrum with a slender backwardly-directed
dorsal or neural arch, similar to those of the posterior trunk
vertebrae. The two halves of the ventral or haemal arch
however do not form outwardly-directed ventri-lateral processes,
but arise on the ventral surface of the centrum, and
passing downwards meet and enclose a space; they thus
form a complete canal, and are prolonged into a backwardly-directed
ventral or <b>haemal spine</b>. The anterior haemal
arches are much larger than the corresponding neural arches,
but when followed back they gradually decrease in size, till at
about the twenty-fourth caudal vertebra they are nearly as
small as the neural arches. The last caudal vertebra is succeeded
by a much flattened <b>hypural</b> bone or <b>urostyle</b>, which
together with the posterior neural and haemal spines supports
the tail-fin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Ribs.</span></p>

<p>The <b>ribs</b> are slender, more or less cylindrical bones attached
to the poster-dorsal faces of the ventri-lateral processes
of all the trunk vertebrae except the first and second.
The earlier ones are thicker and more curved; the later ones
thinner and more nearly straight. The ribs are homologous
with the distal parts of the haemal arches of the caudal
vertebrae.</p>

<p>Associated with the ribs are a second series of rib-like
bones, the <b>intermuscular bones</b>. These are slender, curved
bones which arise from the ribs or from the ventri-lateral
processes at a distance of about an inch from the centra, and
curve upwards, outwards and backwards. In the anterior
region where the ventri-lateral processes are short they arise
from the ribs, further back they arise from the ventri-lateral
processes.</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Unpaired or Median Fins.</span></p>

<p>These are six in number, three being <b>dorsal</b>, one <b>caudal</b>
and two <b>anal</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>dorsal</b> and <b>anal</b> fins each consist of two sets of
structures, the <b>fin-rays</b> and the <b>interspinous bones</b>. Each
fin-ray forms a delicate, nearly straight, bony rod which
becomes thickened and bifurcated at its proximal or vertebral
end, while distally it is transversely jointed and flexible,
frequently also becoming more or less flattened.</p>

<p>The first dorsal fin has thirteen rays, the second, sixteen to
nineteen, the third, seventeen to nineteen. The first anal fin
has about twenty-two, the second anal fourteen. In each
fin the posterior rays rapidly decrease in size when followed
back.</p>

<p>The <b>interspinous bones</b> of the dorsal and anal fins
alternate with the neural and haemal spines respectively, and
form short, forwardly-projecting bones, each attached proximally
to the base of the corresponding fin-ray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>caudal fin</b> consists of a series of about forty-three
rays which radiate from the posterior end of the vertebral
column, being connected with the urostyle or hypural bone,
and with the posterior neural and haemal spines without the
intervention of interspinous bones. Like the other fin-rays
those forming the caudal fin are transversely jointed, and are
widened and frayed out distally.</p>

<p>The tail-fin in the Cod is <b>homocercal</b>, i.e. it appears
to be symmetrically developed round the posterior end of
the vertebral column, though in reality a much greater proportion
is attached below the end of the vertebral column than
above it. It is a masked heterocercal tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>Owing to the fact that very little cartilage remains in
the skull of the adult Codfish, its relation to the completely
cartilaginous skull of the Dogfish is not easily seen. Before
describing it therefore, the skull of the Salmon will be described,
as it forms an intermediate type.</p>

<p>THE SKULL OF THE SALMON<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p>The Salmon's skull consists of (1) the <b>chondrocranium</b>,
which remains partly cartilaginous and is partly converted
into cartilage bone, especially in the occipital region, (2) a
large series of plate-like membrane bones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chondrocranium.</span></p>

<p>This is an elongated structure, wide behind owing to the
fusion of the large auditory capsules with the cranium, and
elongated and tapering considerably in front; in the middle
it is much contracted by the large orbital cavities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorsal surface of the Cranium.</span></p>

<p>In the centre of the posterior end of the dorsal surface
is the <b>supra-occipital</b> (fig. 9, A, 1) with a prominent posterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ridge. It is separated by two tracts of unossified cartilage
from the large series of bones connected with the <b>auditory
organ</b>. The first of these is the <b>epi-otic</b> (fig. 9, 2), which is
separated by only a narrow tract of cartilage from the supra-occipital,
and is continuous laterally with the large <b>pterotic</b>
(fig. 9, A, 3) which overlaps in front a smaller bone, the
<b>sphenotic</b> (fig. 9, 4). Both epi-otic and pterotic are drawn out
into rather prominent backwardly-projecting processes.</p>

<p>The greater part of the remainder of the dorsal surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is formed of unossified cartilage which is pierced by three
large vacuities or <b>fontanelles</b>. The anterior fontanelle is
unpaired, and lies far forward near the anterior end of the
long cartilaginous snout, the two larger posterior ones lie
just in front of the supra-occipital and lead into the cranial
cavity. In front of the orbit the skull widens again, and
is marked by two considerable <b>lateral ethmoid</b> (fig. 9, 8)
ossifications. In front of these are a pair of deep pits, the
<b>nasal fossae</b>, at the base of which are a pair of foramina
through which the olfactory nerves pass out; they communicate
with a space, the <b>middle narial cavity</b>, seen in a longitudinal
section of the skull.</p>

<p>The long cartilaginous snout is more or less bifid in front,
especially in the male (fig. 9).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Posterior end of the Cranium.</span></p>

<p>The <b>foramen magnum</b> forms a large round hole leading
into the cranial cavity, and is bounded laterally by the two
<b>exoccipitals</b> and below by them, and to a very slight extent
by the <b>basi-occipital</b>, the three bones together forming a
concave <b>occipital condyle</b> by which the vertebral column
articulates with the skull.</p>

<p>The exoccipitals are connected laterally with a fourth
pair of auditory bones, the <b>opisthotics</b>, and just meet the
epi-otics dorsolaterally, while dorsally they are separated by a
wide tract of unossified cartilage from the supra-occipital.</p>

<p>The opisthotics are connected laterally with the pterotics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Side of the Cranium.</span></p>

<p>At the posterior end is seen the <b>basi-occipital</b> in contact
above with the <b>exoccipital</b>, which is pierced by a prominent
foramen for the exit of the tenth nerve. In front of this lies
a small foramen, sometimes double, for the ninth nerve.</p>

<p>In front of the exoccipital is the large <b>pro-otic</b> pierced
by two prominent foramina. Through the more dorsal of these
(fig. 10, VII.) the facial nerve passes out, while the more
ventral (fig. 10, 16) is for the passage of an artery. Dorsal to
the exoccipital are the <b>opisthotic</b> and <b>pterotic</b>, and dorsal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the pro-otic is the <b>sphenotic</b>. The <b>pterotic</b> is marked by a
prominent groove often lined by cartilage, which is continued
forwards along a tract of cartilage between the pro-otic and
sphenotic. With this groove the hyomandibular articulates.</p>

<p>There are considerable ossifications in the sphenoidal region
of the side of the cranium. The anterior boundary of the posterior
fontanelle is formed by the large <b>alisphenoid</b>, which
is continuous behind with the pro-otic and sphenotic, and
below with a slender <b>basisphenoid</b>. Both in front of and
behind the basisphenoid there are considerable vacuities in the
walls of the cranium; through the posterior of these openings
(fig. 10, V.) the main part of the trigeminal nerve passes out,
and through the anterior one, the optic (fig. 10, II.). The
alisphenoid is continuous in front with the <b>orbitosphenoid</b>
(fig. 10, 10), which is pierced by the foramen for the exit of
the first nerve (fig. 10, I.), and in front of the orbitosphenoid
there is a large vacuity. The <b>lateral ethmoid</b> is seen in the
side view as well as in the dorsal view. Further forwards are
seen the olfactory pits, and the long cartilaginous snout.</p>

<p>A <b>ventral view</b> of the cartilaginous cranium shows much
the same points as the side view. The basisphenoid appears
on the surface immediately in front of the basi-occipital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Skull with membrane bones.</span></p>

<p>The <b>dorsal surface</b>. The greater part of the dorsal
surface in front of the supra-occipital is overlaid by a pair
of large rough <i>frontals</i> (figs. 9, A, 5, and 10, 5). They cover
the posterior fontanelles and stretch over from the sphenotic
to the lateral ethmoid, forming a roof for the orbit. They
meet in the middle line behind, but in front are separated
by a narrow tract of unossified cartilage, and are overlapped
by the <i>median ethmoid</i> (figs. 9, A, 6, and 11, 6). At the sides
of the supra-occipital behind the frontals are a pair of small
<i>parietals</i> (figs. 9, A, 7, and 11, 7).</p>

<p>In a <b>ventral view</b> the cranium is seen to be chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
covered by two large membrane bones, the <i>parasphenoid</i>
(fig. 9, B, 9) behind, the <i>vomer</i> in front. A view of the
<b>posterior end</b> differs from that of the cartilaginous cranium
only in the fact that the end of the <i>parasphenoid</i> appears
lying ventral to the basi-occipital.</p>

<p>The <b>lateral view</b> differs very markedly from that of the
cartilaginous cranium, there being a great development of
membrane bone in connection with the jaws and branchial
apparatus. Lying dorsally are seen the <i>median ethmoid</i>, <i>frontal</i>,
<i>parietal</i>, and <b>supra-occipital</b> as before. Lying external to
the middle of the <i>median ethmoid</i> is seen the small <i>nasal</i>
(fig. 11, 8), and below the hinder part is the <i>lachrymal</i>. The
<i>lachrymal</i> (fig. 11, 9) forms the first of a series of seven small
bones which surround the orbit forming the <b>orbital ring</b>.
Of these the one lying immediately in the mid-ventral line of
the orbit is the <i>suborbital</i>, while the one lying in the mid-dorsal
line and attached to the frontal is the <i>supra-orbital</i>
(fig. 11, 11). The orbit has a cartilaginous <i>sclerotic</i> in which
are two small ossifications (fig. 11, 13) laterally placed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bones of the upper jaw.</span></p>

<p>The <b>palato-pterygo-quadrate bar</b> is in a very different
condition from that of the dogfish, it is partially cartilaginous,
partially converted into cartilage bone, partially overlapped by
membrane bone. It is narrow in front but becomes much
broader and deeper when followed back. Its anterior end forms
the <b>palatine</b> which bears teeth, and in front is completely
ossified, while behind the cartilage is only sheathed by bone.</p>

<p>Just behind the palatine the outer part of the cartilage is
ossified, forming two small bones, the <b>pterygoid</b> and <b>meso-pterygoid</b>,
while behind them is a larger, somewhat square
bone, the <b>meta-pterygoid</b> (fig. 11, 15).</p>

<p>Below the meta-pterygoid is a tract of unossified cartilage,
and then comes the <b>quadrate</b> (fig. 11, 18).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The lower angle of the quadrate bears a cartilaginous <b>condyle</b>
with which the mandible articulates. In front of the
palatine the cartilaginous snout is overlapped by three membrane
bones, the <i>jugal</i>, <i>maxilla</i> and <i>premaxillae</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>premaxillae</i> (fig. 11, 20), the largest of these, overlaps
the maxilla behind; both bones bear teeth. The <i>jugal</i> (fig. 11,
17) lies above the maxilla and overlaps it in front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The lower jaw.</span></p>

<p>The <b>lower jaw</b> is a strong bar and is like the upper jaw,
partly cartilaginous, forming <b>Meckel's cartilage</b>, partly ossified,
and sheathed to a considerable extent in membrane bone.</p>

<p>The outer side and posterior end is ossified, forming the
large <b>articular</b> (fig. 11, 21), but the condyle is cartilaginous
and the anterior part of the articular forms merely a splint on
the outer side of Meckel's cartilage, which extends beyond it
for a considerable distance. The angle of the jaw just below
the condyle is formed by a small <i>angular</i> (fig. 11, 22), and the
anterior two-thirds of the jaw is sheathed in the large tooth-bearing
<i>dentary</i> (fig. 11, 23).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Hyoid arch.</span></p>

<p>The <b>hyoid arch</b> has a number of ossifications in it and is
closely connected with the mandibular arch.</p>

<p>The <b>hyomandibular</b> (fig. 11, 24) is a large bone which
articulates with a shallow groove lined by cartilage and formed
partly in the pterotic, partly in front of it. The hyomandibular
is overlapped in front by the meta-pterygoid, while below it
tapers and is succeeded by a small area of unossified cartilage
followed by the forwardly-directed <b>symplectic</b> which fits
into a groove in the quadrate.</p>

<p>The unossified tract between the hyomandibular and symplectic
is continuous in front with a strong bar, which remains
partly cartilaginous and is partly converted into cartilage
bone. The proximal part is ossified, forming the <b>epi-hyal</b>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
middle part forms the <b>cerato-hyal</b> (fig. 11, 27), in front of
which is the small <b>hypo-hyal</b>. The hyoid arches of the two
sides are united by the large tooth-bearing <b>glosso-hyal</b> (fig. 11,
29). Attached to the lower surface of the hyoid arch are a series
of twelve flat <i>branchiostegal rays</i> (fig. 11, 35). Each overlaps
the one in front of it, the posterior one being the largest. The
branchiostegal rays of the two sides are united in front by an
unpaired membrane bone, the <i>basi-branchiostegal</i> (fig. 11, 36).</p>

<p><b>Opercular bones.</b> Behind the hyomandibular there is a
large bony plate, the <b>operculum</b>, formed of four large membrane
bones. The anterior of these, the <i>pre-opercular</i> (fig. 11,
33), is crescentic in shape, and with its upper end a small
<i>supratemporal</i> (fig. 11, 34) is connected.</p>

<p>Behind the upper part of the pre-opercular is the largest of
the opercular bones, the <i>opercular proper</i>. Its lower edge
overlaps the sub-opercular, and both opercular and sub-opercular
are overlapped by the <i>infra-opercular</i> (fig. 11, 32)
in front. The infra-opercular is in its turn overlapped by
the <i>pre-opercular</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Branchial arches.</span></p>

<p>There are five branchial arches, the first four of which
bear gill rays. Each of the first three consists of a shorter
upper portion directed obliquely backwards and outwards,
and a longer lower portion forming a right angle with the
upper and directed obliquely forwards and inwards. The
greater part of each arch is ossified.</p>

<p>The upper part of either of the first two consists of a short
tapering <b>pharyngo-branchial</b> directed inwards, and of a
long <b>epi-branchial</b> tipped with cartilage at both ends. The
junction of the upper and lower parts is formed by a cartilaginous
hinge-joint between the epi-branchial and cerato-branchial.
The <b>cerato-branchial</b> is a long bony rod separated
by a short area of cartilage from the <b>hypo-branchial</b>,
which is succeeded by the <b>basibranchial</b> meeting its fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in the middle line. The <b>fourth arch</b> has a short epi-branchial
and no ossified pharyngo-branchial, while the fifth is reduced
to little more than the cerato-branchial, which bears a few
teeth on its inner edge. All the branchial arches have projecting
from their surfaces a number of little processes which
act as strainers. The first and fourth arches have one series
of these, the second and third have two.</p>


<p>THE SKULL OF THE CODFISH<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>A full description having been already given of the Salmon's
skull, that of the Codfish will be described in a briefer manner.
The skull is very fully ossified, and the great number of plate-like
bones render it a very complicated structure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cranium.</span></p>

<p>At the posterior end of the dorsal surface is the large
<b>supra-occipital</b>, which is drawn out behind into the large
blade-like <b>occipital spine</b>. On each side of the supra-occipital
are the small irregular <i>parietals</i>, while in front of it the
roof of the skull is mainly formed by the very large unpaired
<i>frontal</i>.</p>

<p>A complicated series of bones are developed in connection
with the <b>auditory capsule</b>, which forms a large projecting
mass united with the side of the cranium and drawn out behind
into a pair of strong processes, the <b>epi-otic</b> and <b>parotic</b>
processes. Both these processes are connected behind with a
large V-shaped bone, the <i>post-temporal</i> (fig. 13, 1), which will
be described when dealing with the pectoral girdle. The <b>epi-otic
process</b> is formed by the <b>epi-otic</b>, which is continuous in
front with the parietal. The <b>parotic process</b> is formed by
two larger bones, a more dorsal one, the <b>pterotic</b>, and a more
ventral and internal one, the <b>opisthotic</b>, which is continuous
in front with the large <b>pro-otic</b>. Intervening between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pterotic and frontal is another rather large bone, the <b>sphenotic</b>,
this articulates below with the pro-otic. The pterotic and
sphenotic together give rise to a large concave surface by
which the hyomandibular articulates with the cranium.
Several of the cranial nerves pass out through the bones of
the auditory capsule. The ninth leaves by a foramen near
the posterior border of the opisthotic, the fifth and seventh by
a notch in the anterior border of the pro-otic.</p>

<p>A number of bones are likewise developed in connection
with the orbit forming the <b>orbital ring</b>. Of these the most
anterior, the <i>lachrymal</i>, is much the largest, the others are
five to seven in number, the most ventral being the <i>suborbital</i>.
The sclerotic coat of the eye is cartilaginous.</p>

<p>Two pairs of bones and one unpaired bone are developed in
connection with the <b>olfactory capsules</b>, of these, the <i>nasals</i>
are narrow bones lying next the lachrymals, but nearer the
middle line; they overlap the second pair of bones, the irregular
<b>lateral ethmoids</b>. These meet one another in the
middle line, and are overlapped behind by the frontal. They
articulate laterally with the lachrymal and palatine, and ventrally
with the parasphenoid.</p>

<p>In a <b>posterior view</b> the foramen magnum and the four
bones which surround it and together form the occipital segment
are well seen. On the ventral side is the <b>basi-occipital</b>,
terminated posteriorly by a slightly concave surface which
articulates with the centrum of the first vertebra. The sides
of the foramen magnum are formed by the <b>exoccipitals</b>, a
pair of very irregular bones, pierced by a pair of prominent
foramina for the exit of the tenth nerves. The exoccipitals
also bear a pair of surfaces for articulation with corresponding
ones on the neural arch of the first vertebra. The most dorsal
of the four bones is the supra-occipital.</p>

<p>On the ventral surface of the cranium in front of the basi-occipital
is seen the <i>parasphenoid</i>, a very long narrow bone
which underlies the greater part of the cranium. Behind, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
articulates dorsally with the basi-occipital and dorsolaterally
with the pro-otics and opisthotics, in front it articulates
dorsally with the lateral ethmoid and ventrally with the
vomer. At the sides of the parasphenoid are the small <b>alisphenoids</b>
articulating above with the postfrontals, in front
with the frontals, and behind with the pro-otics.</p>

<p>The <i>vomer</i> is an unpaired bone lying immediately in front
of the parasphenoid. In front it terminates with a thickened
curved margin bearing several rows of small teeth; behind
it tapers out into a long process which underlies the anterior
part of the parasphenoid. Immediately dorsal to the vomer
is another median bone, the <i>median ethmoid</i>; this is truncated
in front and tapers out behind into a process which fits into a
groove on the ventral side of the frontal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bones in connection with the upper jaw.</span></p>

<p>These bear a close resemblance to those of the Salmon.
The most anterior bone is the <i>premaxillae</i>, a thick curved bone
meeting its fellow in the middle line. The point of junction
of the two is drawn out into a short process, and the oral
surface is thickly covered with small teeth. The dorsal ends
of the premaxillae are seen in the fresh skull to meet a large
patch of cartilage. Behind the premaxillae is the <i>maxilla</i>, a
long rod-like toothless bone, somewhat expanded at the upper
end where it articulates with the premaxillae and vomer.</p>

<p>Articulating in front with the anterior end of the maxilla
and with the <b>lateral ethmoid</b> is a very irregular bone, the
<b>palatine</b> (fig. 12, 1); it articulates behind with two flat
bones, the <b>pterygoid</b> and <b>meso-pterygoid</b>. The pterygoid
is united behind with two more bones, the <b>quadrate</b>
(fig. 12, 4) and <b>meta-pterygoid</b>. The <b>quadrate</b> is a rather
stout irregular bone, bearing on its lower surface a prominent
saddle-shaped articulating surface for the mandible.
The palatine, pterygoid and quadrate bones are the ossified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
representatives of the palato-pterygo-quadrate bar of the
Dogfish.</p>

<p>The quadrate is united behind with the <b>symplectic</b>
(fig. 12, 5), and the meta-pterygoid with the symplectic and
<b>hyomandibular</b>, both of which bones will be described immediately
in connection with the hyoid arch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Lower jaw.</span></p>

<p>The <b>lower jaw or mandible</b> like that of the Salmon is
partly cartilaginous, forming <b>Meckel's cartilage</b>, partly
formed of cartilage bone, partly of membrane bone. Meckel's
cartilage is of course not seen in the dried skull.</p>

<p>The lower jaw includes one cartilage bone, the <b>articular</b>
(fig. 12, 9), this is a large bone connected by a saddle-shaped
surface with the quadrate. Meckel's cartilage lies in
a groove on its under surface, and projects beyond it in front.
The <i>angular</i> is a small thick bone united to the lower surface
of the articular at its posterior end. The <i>dentary</i> (fig. 12, 10)
is a large tooth-bearing bone meeting its fellow in the middle
line in front, while the articular fits into a deep notch at its
posterior end.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The hyoid arch.</span></p>

<p>The <b>hyomandibular</b> (fig. 12, 7) is a large irregular bone,
articulating by a prominent rounded head with the sphenotic
and pterotic. It is united in front with the meta-pterygoid
and symplectic, and sends off behind a strong process which
articulates with the opercular. The <b>symplectic</b> is a long
somewhat triangular bone drawn out in front into a process
which fits into a groove on the inner surface of the quadrate.
The distal portion of the hyoid arch is strongly developed and
consists of first the <b>inter-hyal</b> (fig. 12, 11), a short bony rod,
which articulates dorsally with a patch of cartilage intervening
between the posterior part of the hyomandibular and the symplectic.
Below it is united with the apex of the triangular
<b>epi-hyal</b>, a bone suturally connected with the large <b>cerato-hyal</b>
(fig. 12, 13) which unites distally with two small <b>hypo-hyals</b>.
To the cerato-hyal are attached a series of seven
strong curved cylindrical rods, the <i>branchiostegal rays</i>. The
first of these is the smallest and they increase in size up to the
last. The four dorsal ones are attached to the outer surface
of the cerato-hyal, the three ventral ones to its inner surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Interposed between the hypo-hyals of the two sides is an
unpaired somewhat triangular plate, the uro-hyal or <i>basi-branchiostegal</i>
(fig. 12, 15).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The branchial arches.</span></p>

<p>The <b>branchial arches</b> are five in number and consist of
the following parts on each side. The dorsal end is formed of
the <b>supra-pharyngeal</b> bone, a large irregular bone covered
ventrally with teeth of a fair size, and representing the fused
<b>pharyngo-branchials</b> of the four anterior arches. Its external
surface is continuous with four small <b>epi-branchials</b> which
pass horizontally backwards and outwards. Their distal ends
meet four long <b>cerato-branchials</b> which are directed forwards
and inwards and form the principal part of the arches.</p>

<p>Each of the first three cerato-branchials articulates ventrally
with a <b>hypo-branchial</b>, and the hypo-branchials of
the two sides are united in the middle line by an unpaired
<b>basibranchial</b>. The third hypo-branchial is much flattened.
The fourth cerato-branchial is united by cartilage with the
posterior surface of the third hypo-branchial, which it meets
near the middle line.</p>

<p>The fifth arch consists only of the cerato-branchial, a wide
structure covered with teeth and generally called the <b>inferior
pharyngeal bone</b>.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the <b>operculum</b> consists of the same four
bones as in the Salmon, namely the <i>opercular</i>, the <i>infra-opercular</i>,
the <i>pre-opercular</i> and the <i>sub-opercular</i>. Of these
the anterior bone, the <i>pre-opercular</i>, is the largest, while the
<i>infra-opercular</i> is the smallest. The <i>opercular</i> has a facet for
articulation with the hyomandibular.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral girdle.</span></p>

<p>This is of a highly specialised type. Membrane bones are
greatly developed, and the cartilage bones, the <b>scapula</b> and
<b>coracoid</b>, are much reduced in size and importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The largest bone in the shoulder girdle is the <i>clavicle</i>
(fig. 13, 3), which is irregularly crescent shaped, thick in front
and tapering off behind. To the outer side of its upper part
is attached a thick cylindrical bone, the <i>supra-clavicle</i>, which
passes upwards and is connected with a strong <b>V</b> shaped
bone, the <i>post-temporal</i>. The apex of the <b>V</b> meets the supra-clavicle,
the inner limb articulates with the epi-otic process,
the outer with the parotic process. Projecting downwards from
the upper part of the clavicle is a long bony rod, flattened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
proximally and cylindrical and pointed distally, this is the
<i>post-clavicle</i> (fig. 13, 6).</p>

<p>The <b>scapula</b> (fig. 13, 5) is a small irregular plate of bone
attached to the inner side of the middle of the <i>clavicle</i>. The
<b>coracoid</b><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> is a larger plate of similar character, irregularly
triangular in shape, attached to the inner side of the clavicle
immediately below the scapula. The scapula and coracoid
bear the pectoral fin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral fins.</span></p>

<p>Each of these consists of four small irregular bones, the
<b>brachial ossicles</b> (fig. 13, 7), bearing a series of about nineteen
dermal <i>fin-rays</i>. The brachial ossicles represent the reduced
and modified radiale and basalia of cartilaginous fish such as
the dogfish. The fin-rays (fig. 13, 8) which form the whole
external portion of the fin are long slender rods having
essentially the same character as those of the unpaired fins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic girdle.</span></p>

<p>The <b>pelvic girdle</b> in the Cod as in other Teleosteans is
entirely absent, its place being taken by the enlarged basi-pterygia
of the fins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic fins.</span></p>

<p>These have a very anomalous position in the Cod, being
attached to the throat in front of the pectoral girdle. Each
consists of a basal portion, the <b>basi-pterygium</b>, and of a
number of dermal rays. The basi-pterygium consists of an
expanded ventral portion which meets its fellow below in the
middle line, and to which the rays are attached, and of an inwardly-directed
dorsal portion which also meets its fellow and
is imbedded in the flesh. The rays are six in number and
are long slender structures similar to those of the other fins.</p>

<small>GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN
FISHES<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</small></h2>


<p>EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The most primitive type of exoskeleton is that found in
Elasmobranchs and formed of <b>placoid</b> scales; these are tooth-like
structures consisting of dentine and bone capped with
enamel, and have been already described (p. 4). In most
Elasmobranchs they are small and their distribution is fairly
uniform, but in the Thornback skate, <i>Raia clavata</i>, they have
the form of larger, more scattered spines. In adult Holocephali
and in <i>Polyodon</i> and <i>Torpedo</i> there is no exoskeleton,
in young Holocephali, however, there are a few small dorsal
ossifications.</p>

<p>The plates or scales of many Ganoids may have been
formed by the gradual fusion of elements similar to these
placoid scales, and often bear a number of little tooth-like
processes. In <i>Lepidosteus</i>, <i>Polypterus</i>, and many extinct
species, these <i>ganoid</i> scales, which are rhomboidal in form
and united to one another by a peg and socket articulation,
enclose the body in a complete armour. In <i>Trissolepis</i> part of
the tail is covered by rhomboidal scales, while rounded scales
cover the trunk and remainder of the tail. <i>Acipenser</i> and
<i>Scaphirhynchus</i> have large dermal bony plates which are not
rhomboidal in shape and do not cover the whole body. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<i>Acipenser</i> a single row extends along the middle of the back
and two along each side.</p>

<p>The majority of Teleosteans have thin flattened scales
which differ from those of Ganoids in being entirely mesodermal
in origin, containing no enamel. There are two principal
types of Teleostean scales, the cycloid and ctenoid. A
<b>cycloid</b> scale is a flat thin scale with concentric markings
and an entire posterior margin. A <b>ctenoid</b> scale differs in
having its posterior margin pectinate. The Dipnoi have overlapping
cycloid scales. The rounded scales of <i>Amia</i> and of many
fossil ganoids such as <i>Holoptychius</i> are shaped like cycloid
scales, but differ from them in being more or less coated with
enamel. In Eels and some other Teleosteans the scales are
completely degenerate and have almost disappeared. Some
Teleosteans, like <i>Diodon hystrix</i>, have scales with triradiate
roots from which arise long sharp spines directed backwards.
These scales, which resemble teeth, contain no enamel; they
become erect when the fish inflates its body into a globular
form. Many Siluroids have dermal armour in the form of
large bony plates which are confined to the anterior part
of the body. In <i>Ostracion</i> the whole body is covered by
hexagonal plates, closely united together.</p>

<p>The <b>fin-rays</b> are structures of dermal origin which entirely
or partially support the unpaired fins, and assist the bony
or cartilaginous endoskeleton in the support of the paired fins.</p>

<p>In Elasmobranchs, Dipnoi, and Chondrosteous ganoids the
skeletons of the fins are, as a rule, about half of exoskeletal,
half of endoskeletal origin, the proximal and inner portion
being cartilaginous and endoskeletal, the distal and outer portion
being exoskeletal, and consisting of horny or of more or less
calcified fin-rays. In bony Ganoids and Teleosteans the endoskeletal
parts are greatly reduced and the fins come to consist
mainly of the fin-rays, which are ossified and frequently become
flattened at their distal ends.</p>

<p>The fin-rays of the ventral part of the caudal fin are carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
by the haemal arches; those of the dorsal and anal fins and
of the dorsal part of the caudal fin generally by interspinous
bones, which in adult Teleosteans alternate with the neural
and haemal spines. In Dipnoi these interspinous bones articulate
with the neural and haemal spines. In many Siluroids
the anterior rays of the dorsal and pectoral fins are developed
into large spines which often articulate with the endoskeleton, or
are sometimes fused with the dermal armour plates. Similar
spines may occur in Ganoids in front of both the dorsal and
anal fins. <i>Polypterus</i> has a small spine or <i>fulcrum</i> in front of
each segment of the dorsal fin. Such spines are often found
fossilised, and are known as <i>ichthyodorulites</i>.</p>

<p>Similar spines are found in many Elasmobranchs, but they
are simply inserted in the flesh, not articulated to the endoskeleton.
They also differ from the spines of Teleosteans
and Ganoids in the fact that they are covered with enamel,
and often have their edges serrated like teeth. In the extinct
Acanthodii they generally occur in front of all the fins, paired
and unpaired.</p>

<p>In <i>Trygon</i>, the Sting-ray, the tail bears a serrated spine
which is used for purposes of offence and defence. Many
ichthyodorulites may have been spines of this nature fixed to
the tail, rather than spines situated in front of the fins. The
spines, which are always found in front of the dorsal fin in
Holocephali, agree with those of Elasmobranchs in containing
enamel, and with those of Teleosteans in being articulated to
the endoskeleton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth.</span></p>

<p>The teeth of fish<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> are subject to a very large amount of
variation, perhaps to more variation than are those of any
other class of animals. Sometimes, as in adult Sturgeons,
they are entirely absent, sometimes they are found on all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
bones of the mouth, and also on the hyoid and branchial
arches. The teeth are all originally developed in the mucous
membrane of the mouth, but they afterwards generally become
attached to firmer structures, especially to the jaws. In
Elasmobranchs, however, they are generally simply imbedded
in the tough fibrous integument of the mouth. Their attachment
to the jaws may take place in three different ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;">

<p>(1) By an elastic hinge-joint, as in the Angler (<i>Lophius</i>),
and the Pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>). In the Angler the tooth is held
by a fibrous band attaching its posterior end to the subjacent
bone, in the Pike by uncalcified elastic rods in the pulp cavity.</p>

<p>(2) By ankylosis, i.e. by the complete union of the calcified
tooth substance with the subjacent bone. This is the
commonest method among fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) By implantation in sockets. This method is not very
common among fish. The teeth are sometimes, as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>,
ankylosed to the base of the socket. In this genus
there is along each ramus of the mandible a median row of
large teeth placed in perfect sockets, and two irregular lateral
rows of small teeth ankylosed to the jaw.</p>

<p>Dentine, enamel and cement are all represented in the teeth
of fishes, but the enamel is generally very thin, and cement is
but rarely developed. Dentine forms the main bulk of the
teeth; it is sometimes of the normal type, but generally differs
from that in higher vertebrates in being vascular, and is
known as <i>vasodentine</i>. A third type occurs, known as <i>osteodentine</i>;
it is traversed by canals occupied by marrow, and is
closely allied to bone.</p>

<p>The teeth are generally continually renewed throughout life,
but sometimes one set persists.</p>

<p>The teeth of Selachii are fundamentally identical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
placoid scales. They are developed from a layer of dental germs
which occurs all over the surface of the skin, except in the
region of the lips. At this point the layer of tooth-producing
germs extends back into the mouth, being projected by a fold
of the mucous membrane (fig. 14, 7). Here new teeth are
successively formed, and as they grow each is gradually
brought into a position to take the place of its predecessor
by the shifting outwards of the gum over the jaw. Owing to
this arrangement sharks have practically an unlimited supply
of teeth (figs. 14 and 15).</p>

<p>Two principal types of teeth are found in <span class="smcap">Elasmobranchs</span>.
In Sharks and Dogfish, on the one hand, the teeth are very
numerous, simple, and sharp-pointed, and are with or without
serrations and lateral cusps. Many Rays and fossil Elasmobranchs,
on the other hand, have broad flattened teeth adapted
for crushing shells. Intermediate conditions occur between
these two extremes. Thus in <i>Cestracion</i> and many extinct
sharks, such as <i>Acrodus</i>, while the median teeth are sharp,
the lateral teeth are more or less flattened and adapted for
crushing. In various species belonging to the genus <i>Raia</i> the
teeth of the male are sharp, while those of the female are blunt.
A very specialised dentition is met with in the Eagle-rays
(Myliobatidae), in which the jaws are armed with flattened
angular tooth-plates, arranged in seven rows, forming a compact
pavement; the plates of the middle row are very wide
and rectangular, those of the other rows are much smaller and
hexagonal. Lastly, in <i>Cochliodus</i> the individual crushing
teeth are fused, forming two pairs of spirally-coiled dental
plates on each side of each jaw. <i>Pristis</i>, the Saw-fish, has a
long flat cartilaginous snout, bearing a double row of persistently-growing
teeth planted in sockets along its sides. Each
tooth consists of a number of parallel dentinal columns, united
at the base, but elsewhere distinct.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Holocephali</span>&mdash;<i>Chimaera</i>, <i>Hariotta</i> and <i>Callorhynchus</i>&mdash;only
three pairs of teeth or dental plates occur, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pairs in the upper jaw, one in the lower. These structures
persist throughout life and grow continuously. The upper
tooth structures are attached respectively to the ethmoid or
vomerine region of the skull, and to the palato-pterygoids. The
vomerine teeth are small, while those attached to the mandible
and the palato-pterygoid region are large and bear several
roughened ridges adapted for grinding food. The teeth of
the two opposite sides of the jaw meet in a median symphysis.
The teeth of <i>Chimaera</i> are more adapted for cutting, those of
<i>Callorhynchus</i> for crushing. Many extinct forms are known,
some of whose teeth are intermediate in structure between
those of <i>Chimaera</i> and <i>Callorhynchus</i>.</p>

<p>The teeth of <span class="smcap">Ganoids</span> are also extremely variable. Among
living forms, the Holostei are more richly provided with teeth
than are any other fishes, as they may occur on the premaxillae,
maxillae, palatines, pterygoids, parasphenoid, vomers,
dentaries, and splenials. Among the Chondrostei, on the other
hand, the adult Acipenseridae are toothless; small teeth however
occur in the larval sturgeon, and in <i>Polyodon</i> many
small teeth are found attached merely to the mucous membrane
of the jaws. Many fossil Ganoids have numerous flattened or
knob-like teeth, borne on the maxillae, palatines, vomers and
dentaries. Others have a distinctly heterodont dentition.
Thus in <i>Lepidotus</i> the premaxillae bear chisel-like teeth, while
knob-like teeth occur on the maxillae, palatines and vomers.
In <i>Rhizodus</i> all the teeth are pointed, but while the majority
are small a few very large ones are interspersed.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Teleosteans</span>, too, the teeth are eminently variable both
in form and mode of arrangement. They may be simple and
isolated, or compound, and may be borne on almost any of the
bones bounding the mouth cavity, and also as in the Pike, on
the hyoid and branchial arches. The splenial however never
bears teeth and the pterygoid and parasphenoid only rarely,
thus differing from the arrangement in the Holostei.</p>

<p>The isolated teeth are generally conical in form and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
ankylosed to the bone that bears them. Such teeth are,
with a few exceptions such as <i>Balistes</i>, not imbedded in
sockets nor replaced vertically.</p>

<p>In some fish beak-like structures occur, formed partly of
teeth, partly of the underlying jaw bones. These beaks are of
two kinds: (1) In <i>Scarus</i>, the parrot fish, the premaxillae and
dentaries bear numerous small, separately developed teeth,
which are closely packed together and attached by their
proximal ends to the bone, while their distal ends form a
mosaic. Not only the teeth but the jaws which bear them
are gradually worn away at the margins, while both grow
continuously along their attached edge. (2) In Gymnodonts,
e.g. <i>Diodon</i>, the beaks are formed by the coalescence of broad
calcified horizontal plates, which when young are free and
separated from one another by a considerable interval.</p>

<p>In some Teleosteans the differentiation of the teeth into
biting teeth and crushing teeth is as complete as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>.
Thus in the Wrasse (<i>Labrus</i>), the jaws bear conical
slightly recurved teeth arranged in one or two rows, with some
of the anterior ones much larger than the rest. The bones of
the palate are toothless, while both upper and lower pharyngeal
bones are paved with knob-like crushing teeth; such pharyngeal
teeth occur also in the Carp but are attached only to the
lower pharyngeal bone, the jaw bones proper being toothless.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Dipnoi</span> the arrangement of the teeth is very similar to
that in Holocephali. The mandible bears a single pair of
grinding teeth attached to the splenials, and a corresponding
pair occur on the palato-pterygoids. In front of these there
are a pair of small conical vomerine teeth loosely attached to the
ethmoid cartilage. The palato-pterygoid teeth of <i>Ceratodus</i>
are roughly semicircular in shape with a smooth convex inner
border, and an outer border bearing a number of strongly
marked ridges. The teeth of the extinct Dipteridae resemble
those of <i>Ceratodus</i> but are more complicated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<p>ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spinal column</span><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>The spinal column of fishes is divisible into only two
regions, a caudal region in which the haemal arches or ribs
meet one another ventrally, and a precaudal region in which
they do not meet.</p>

<p>The various modifications of the spinal column in fishes
can be best understood by comparing them with the arrangement
in the simplest type known, namely <i>Amphioxus</i>. In
<i>Amphioxus</i> the notochord is immediately surrounded by a
structureless cuticular layer, the <i>chordal sheath</i>. Outside this
is the <i>skeletogenous layer</i>, which in addition to surrounding
the notochord and chordal sheath embraces the nerve cord
dorsally, and laterally sends out septa forming the <i>myomeres</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cartilaginous ganoids</span><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Polyodon</i> and
<i>Scaphirhynchus</i> are the simplest fishes as regards their spinal
column. The notochord remains permanently unconstricted
and is enclosed in a chordal sheath, external to which is the
skeletogenous layer. In this layer the development of cartilaginous
elements has taken place. In connection with each
<i>neuromere</i>, or segment as determined by the points of exit of
the spinal nerves, there are developed two pairs of ventral
cartilages, the ventral arches (basiventralia) and intercalary
pieces (interventralia); and at least two pairs of dorsal pieces,
the neural arches (basidorsalia) and intercalary pieces (interdorsalia).
The lateral parts of the skeletogenous layer do not
become converted into cartilage, so there are no traces of
vertebral centra. The ventral or haemal arches meet one
another ventrally and send out processes to protect the ventral
vessels. The neural arches do not meet, but are united
by a longitudinal elastic band.</p>

<p>In Cartilaginous ganoids the only indications of metameric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
segmentation are found in the neural and haemal arches. The
case is somewhat similar with the Holocephali and Dipnoi.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Holocephali</span> the notochord grows persistently
throughout life, and is of uniform diameter throughout the
whole body except in the cervical region and in the gradually
tapering tail. The chordal sheath is very thick and includes a
well-marked zone of calcification which separates an outer zone of
hyaline cartilage from an inner zone. There are also a number
of cartilaginous pieces derived from the skeletogenous layer
which are arranged in two series, a dorsal series forming the
neural arches and a ventral series forming the haemal arches.
These do not, except in the cervical region, meet one another
laterally round the notochord and form centra. To each
neuromere there occur a pair of basidorsals, a pair of interdorsals,
and one or two supradorsals. In the tail the arrangement
is irregular.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Dipnoi</span> as in the Holocephali the notochord grows
persistently and uniformly, and the chordal sheath is thick
and cartilaginous though there are no metamerically arranged
centra. The neural and haemal arches and spines are cartilaginous
and interbasalia (intercalary pieces) are present. The
basidorsalia and basiventralia do not in <i>Ceratodus</i> meet
round the notochord and enclose it except in the anterior part
of the cervical and posterior part of the caudal region.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Elasmobranchii</span> the chordal sheath is weak and the
skeletogenous layer strong. Biconcave cartilaginous vertebrae
are developed, and as is the case in most fishes, constrict the
notochord <i>vertebrally</i>.</p>

<p>Two distinct types of vertebral column can be distinguished
in Elasmobranchs<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>:</p>

<p>1. In many extinct forms and in the living Notidanidae,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<i>Cestracion</i>, and <i>Squatina</i>, the dorsal and ventral arches do not
meet one another laterally round the centrum, and consequently
readily come away from it.</p>

<p>2. In most living Elasmobranchs the arches meet laterally
round the centrum.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are never ossified but endochondral calcification
nearly always takes place, though it very rarely reaches
the outer surface of the vertebrae. Elasmobranchs are sometimes
subdivided into three groups according to the method
in which this calcification takes place:</p>

<p>1. <b>Cyclospondyli</b> (<i>Scymnus</i>, <i>Acanthias</i>), in which the
calcified matter is deposited as one ring in each vertebra.</p>

<p>2. <b>Tectospondyli</b> (<i>Squatina</i>, <i>Raia</i>, <i>Trygon</i>), in which
there are several concentric rings of calcification.</p>

<p>3. <b>Asterospondyli</b> (Notidanidae, <i>Scyllium</i>, <i>Cestracion</i>),
in which the calcified material instead of forming one simple
ring, extends out in a more or less star-shaped manner.</p>

<p>In <i>Heptanchus</i> the length of the vertebral centra in the
middle of the trunk is double that in the anterior and posterior
portions, and as the length of the arches does not vary, the
long centra carry more of them than do the short centra.</p>

<p>In many Rays the skull articulates with the vertebral
column by distinct occipital condyles.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Bony Ganoids</span> the skeletogenous layer becomes calcified
ectochondrally in such a way that the notochord is pinched in
at intervals, and distinct vertebrae are produced. Ossification
of the calcified cartilage rapidly follows. In <i>Amia</i> the vertebrae
are biconcave, in <i>Lepidosteus</i> they are opisthocoelous, cup
and ball joints being developed between the vertebrae in a
manner unique among fishes. The notochord entirely disappears
in the adult <i>Lepidosteus</i>, but at one stage in larval life
it is expanded vertebrally and constricted intervertebrally in
the manner usual in the higher vertebrata, but unknown
elsewhere among fishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The tail of <i>Amia</i> is remarkable from the fact that as a
rule to each neuromere, as determined by the exit of the
spinal nerves, there are two centra, a posterior one which
bears nothing, and an anterior one which bears the neural and
haemal arches, these being throughout the vertebral column
connected with the centra by cartilaginous discs.</p>

<p>In most <span class="smcap">Teleosteans</span> but not in the Plectognathi the neural
arches are continuous with the centra, which are nearly always
deeply biconcave.</p>

<p>In some cases many of the anterior vertebrae are ankylosed
together and to the skull. The vertebrae often articulate
with one another by means of obliquely placed flattened
surfaces, the zygapophyses. The centrum in early stages of
development is partially cartilaginous, but the neural arches
and spines in the trunk at any rate, pass directly from the
membranous to the osseous condition.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fins.</span></p>

<p>The most primitive fins are undoubtedly the unpaired ones,
which probably originally arose as ridges or folds of skin
along the mid-dorsal line of the body, and passed thence
round the posterior end on to the ventral surface, partially
corresponding in position and function to the keel of a ship.</p>

<p>In long 'fish' which pass through the water with an
undulating motion such simple continuous fins may be the
only ones found, as in <i>Myxine</i>. To support these median fins
skeletal structures came to be developed; these show two
very distinct forms, viz. cartilaginous endoskeletal pieces, the
<i>radiale</i>, and horny exoskeletal fibres, the <i>fin-rays</i>. Mechanical
reasons caused the fin to become concentrated at
certain points and reduced at intervening regions. Thus a
terminal caudal fin arose and became the chief organ of
propulsion, and the dorsal and ventral fins became specialised
to act as balancing organs.</p>

<p>In some of the earlier Elasmobranchs, the Pleuracanthidae,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the endoskeletal cartilaginous radiale are directly continuous
with outgrowths from the dorsal and ventral arches
of the vertebrae, and form the main part of the fin. In
later types of Elasmobranchs the horny exoskeletal fin-rays
have comparatively greater prominence. In bony fish, as has
been already stated, the horny fibres are replaced by bony
rays of dermal origin, and at the same time complete reduction
and disappearance of the cartilaginous radiale takes
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Caudal fin.</span></p>

<p>The caudal region of the spinal column in fishes is of
special importance. It is distinctly marked off from the rest
of the spinal column by the fact that the ventral or haemal
arches meet one another and are commonly prolonged into
spines, while in the trunk region they do not meet but commonly
diverge from one another.</p>

<p>In some fish the terminal part of the caudal region of the
spinal column retains the same direction as the rest of the
spinal column. The blade of the caudal fin is then divided
into two nearly equal portions, and is said to be <b>diphycercal</b>.
This condition is generally regarded as the most primitive one;
it occurs in the Ichthyotomi, Holocephali, all living Dipnoi,
<i>Polypterus</i> and some extinct Crossopterygii, and a few Selachii
and Teleostei. It occurs also in deep-sea fish belonging to
almost every group, and under these conditions obviously
cannot be regarded as primitive, but must be looked on as
a feature induced by the peculiar conditions of life.</p>

<p>In the great majority of fish the terminal part of the
caudal region of the spinal column is bent dorsalwards, and
the part of the blade of the caudal fin which arises on the
dorsal surface is much smaller than is that arising on the
ventral surface. Such a fin is said to be <b>heterocercal</b>.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking all fish whose tails are not diphycercal
have heterocercal tails, but the term is commonly applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to two-bladed tails in which the spinal column forms a definite
axis running through the dorsal blade, while the ventral blade
is enlarged and generally forms the functional part of the
tail. Such heterocercal tails are found in nearly all Elasmobranchii,
together with the living cartilaginous Ganoidei,
and many extinct forms belonging to the same order; <i>Lepidosteus</i>,
<i>Amia</i>, and the Dipteridae among Dipnoi, have tails
which, though obviously heterocercal, are not two-bladed.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the Teleostei and some extinct Ganoidei
have heterocercal tails of the modified type to which
the term <b>homocercal</b> is applied. The hypural bones which
support the lower half of the tail fin become much enlarged,
and frequently unite to form a wedge-shaped bone which becomes
ankylosed to the last ossified vertebral centrum. The
fin-rays then become arranged in such a way as to produce a
secondary appearance of symmetry. Some homocercal fish
such as the Perch have the end of the notochord protected
by a calcified or completely ossified sheath, the <b>urostyle</b>, to
which several neural and haemal arches may be attached, and
which becomes united with the centrum of the last vertebra;
in others such as the Salmon the end of the notochord is protected
only by laterally placed bony plates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>It is often impossible to draw a hard and fast line between
the cranium and the vertebral column. This is the case for
instance in <i>Acipenser</i> (fig. 18, 16) among Chondrostei, in <i>Amia</i>
among Holostei, and in <i>Ceratodus</i> and <i>Protopterus</i> among
Dipnoi. The occipital region of the skull in <i>Amia</i> is clearly
formed of three cervical vertebrae whose centra have become
absorbed into the cranium, while the neural arches and spines
are still distinguishable.</p>

<p>The simplest type of cranium is that found in <span class="smcap">Elasmobranchs</span>:
it consists of a simple cartilaginous box, which is
generally immovably fixed to the vertebral column, though
in some forms, like <i>Scymnus</i> and <i>Galeus</i>, a joint is indicated,
and in others, such as the Rays, one is fairly well developed.
The cranium in Elasmobranchs is never bony, though the
cartilage is sometimes calcified. It is drawn out laterally
into an antorbital process in front of the eye, and a post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>orbital
process behind it. The nasal capsules are always cartilaginous,
and the eye, as a general rule, has a cartilaginous
sclerotic investment. The cranium is often prolonged in
front into a rostrum which is enormously developed in <i>Pristis</i>
and some Rays. The cartilaginous roof of the cranium is
rendered incomplete by the presence of a large hole, the anterior
fontanelle.</p>

<p>Two pairs of labial cartilages (fig. 16, B, 8) are often
present. They lie imbedded in the cheeks outside the anterior
region of the jaws, and are specially large in <i>Squatina</i>.</p>

<p>As regards the visceral arches<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> the simplest and most primitive
condition of the jaws is that of the Notidanidae, in which
the mandibular and hyoid arches are entirely separate. In
these primitive fishes the palato-pterygo-quadrate bar articulates
with the postorbital process (fig. 16, 10), while further
forwards it is united to the cranium by the ethmo-palatine
ligament. The hyoid arch is small and is broadly overlapped by
the mandibular arch. The term <b>autostylic</b> is used to describe
this condition of the suspensorium. From this condition we
pass in the one direction to that of <i>Cestracion</i> (fig. 16, B), in
which the whole of the palato-pterygo-quadrate bar has become
bound to the cranium, and in the other to that of <i>Scyllium</i>.
In <i>Scyllium</i> (fig. 6), while the ethmo-palatine ligament is
retained, the postorbital articulation of the palato-pterygo-quadrate
has been given up, so that the palato-pterygo-quadrate
comes to abut on the hyomandibular and is attached to it by
ligaments. The pre-spiracular ligament (fig. 16, 20) running
from the auditory capsule also assists in supporting the jaws.</p>

<p>Lastly we come to the purely <b>hyostylic</b> condition met
with in Rays, in which the mandibular arch is entirely supported
by the hyomandibular. In some Rays the hyoid is
attached to the posterior face of the hyomandibular near its
proximal end, and may even come to articulate with the
cranium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>visceral arches of Elasmobranchs</b> may be summarised
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <b>mandibular arch</b>, consisting of a much reduced
dorsal portion, the pre-spiracular ligament, and a greatly developed
ventral portion from which both upper and lower
jaws are derived. The mandible (Meckel's cartilage) is the
original lower member of the mandibular arch, and from it
arises an outgrowth which forms the upper jaw or palato-pterygo-quadrate
bar. In <i>Scymnus</i> this bears a few branchiostegal
rays.</p>

<p>2. The <b>hyoid arch</b>, which consists of the hyomandibular
and the hyoid, and bears branchiostegal rays on its posterior
face.</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>3. The <b>branchial arches</b>, generally five in number, all
of which except the last bear branchiostegal rays. In the
Notidanidae the number of branchial arches is increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
beyond the normal series, thus in <i>Hexanchus</i> there are six, and
in <i>Heptanchus</i> seven. There are six also in <i>Chlamydoselache</i>
and <i>Protopterus</i>.</p>

<p>4. The so-called external branchial arches which are cartilaginous
rods attached to all the visceral arches. They are
especially large in <i>Cestracion</i>.</p>

<p>The skull in <span class="smcap">Holocephali</span> is entirely cartilaginous. The
palato-pterygo-quadrate bar is fixed to the cranium, and to
it the mandible articulates. There is a well-marked joint
between the skull and the spinal column.</p>

<p>In living Cartilaginous <span class="smcap">Ganoids</span> the primitive cartilaginous
cranium is very massive, and is greatly prolonged anteriorly,
while posteriorly it merges into the spinal column. Although it
is mainly cartilaginous a number of ossifications take place in
the skull, and membrane bones are now found definitely developed,
especially in connection with the roof of the cranium.
In <i>Acipenser</i> (fig. 18) the ossifications in the cartilage include
the pro-otic, which is pierced by the foramen for the fifth nerve,
the alisphenoid, orbitosphenoid, ectethmoid, palatine, pterygoid,
meso-pterygoid, hyomandibular (fig. 18, 11), cerato-hyal, all the
cerato-branchials, and the first two epi-branchials. Most of
these structures are, however, partly cartilaginous, though
they include an ossified area. The membrane bones too of
<i>Acipenser</i> are very well developed, they include a bone occupying
the position of the supra-occipital, and form a complete
dorsal cephalic shield. Resting on the ventral surface are a
vomer and a very large parasphenoid (fig. 18, 3). There is a
bony operculum attached to the hyomandibular, and membrane
bones representing respectively the maxilla and dentary are
attached to the jaws. The suspensorium is most markedly
hyostylic. The palato-pterygo-quadrate bar has a very curious
shape and is quite separate from the cranium. It is connected
to the hyomandibular by a thick symplectic ligament containing
a small bone homologous with the symplectic of
Teleosteans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Polyodon</i> differs much from <i>Acipenser</i>, the membrane bones
not being so well developed though they cover the great cartilaginous
snout.</p>

<p>The skull in <i>Polypterus</i> (Crossopterygii) shows a great
advance towards the condition met with in Teleostei. The
cranium remains to a great extent unossified, and large dorsal
and ventral fontanelles pierce its walls. It is covered by a
great development of membrane bones, paired nasals, frontals,
parietals, supra- and post-temporals, and dermo-supra-occipitals
among others being present. The palato-pterygo-quadrate bar
is fused to the cranium, and in connection with it the following
paired membrane bones appear, palatine, ecto-, meso- and meta-pterygoid,
and further forwards jugal, vomer, maxilla and
premaxillae. The membrane bones developed in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with each ramus of the mandible are the dentary, angular,
and splenial, in addition to the cartilage bone the articular.
Several large opercular bones occur. There are also a pair of
large jugular or gular plates, and several large opercular bones.</p>

<p>In Bony Ganoids both cartilage bone and membrane
bone is well developed. The pro-otics and exoccipitals are
well ossified, but the supra-occipital and pterotics are not.
Lateral ethmoids are developed, and there are ossifications in
the sphenoidal region which vary in different forms. The
place of the cartilaginous palato-pterygo-quadrate is taken by
a series of bones, the quadrate behind and the palatine, ecto-,
meso- and meta-pterygoids in front. In <i>Lepidosteus</i>, however,
the palatine and pterygoid are membrane bones, as they are
in <i>Polypterus</i> and the Frog. Paired maxillae, premaxillae,
vomers and a parasphenoid occur forming the upper jaw and
roof of the mouth, and a series of membrane bones are found
investing the mandible and forming the operculum.</p>

<p>In <i>Amia</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> membrane bones are as freely developed as they
are in Teleosteans; they include on each side a squamosal,
four opercular bones, a lachrymal, a pre-orbital, one or two
suborbitals, two large postorbitals and a supratemporal; while
investing the mandible, besides the dentary, splenial, angular,
and supra-angular, there is an unpaired jugular. The articular
too is double and a mento-meckelian occurs. In <i>Amia</i> teeth
are borne on the premaxillae, maxillae, vomers, palatines and
pterygoids.</p>

<p>Bony Ganoids are the lowest animals in which squamosal
bones are found, and they do not occur in Teleosteans.</p>

<p>The suspensorium in bony Ganoids, as in the Chondrostei,
is hyostylic, and there are two ossifications in the hyomandibular
cartilage, viz. the hyomandibular, and the symplectic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The skull of <span class="smcap">Teleostei</span> is very similar to those of <i>Lepidosteus</i>
and <i>Amia</i>. Although the bony skull is greatly developed and
very complicated, much of the original cartilaginous cranium
often persists. Membrane bones are specially developed on
the roof of the skull where they include the parietal, frontal,
and nasal bones. The same bones are developed in connection
with the upper jaw and roof of the mouth as in bony Ganoids,
but only two membrane bones occur in the lower jaw, viz. the
angular and dentary. A number of large ossifications take
place in the cartilage of the auditory capsules. In some forms
parts of the last pair of branchial arches are broadened out
and form the pharyngeal bones which bear teeth. The opercular
bones and those of the upper and lower jaws are quite
comparable to those of bony Ganoids.</p>

<p>A full account of the Teleostean skull has been given in
the case of the Salmon (pp. 87-96) and the Cod (pp. 96-101).</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Dipnoi</span> the skull is mainly cartilaginous, but both
cartilage- and membrane-bone occur also. Cartilage-bone is
found in the ossified exoccipitals, while of membrane-bones
<i>Protopterus</i> has among unpaired bones a fronto-parietal, a
median ethmoid, and a parasphenoid, and among paired bones
nasals and large supra-orbitals. The skull of <i>Ceratodus</i> (fig. 19)
has an almost complete roof of membrane bones, including some
whose homology is doubtful. The ethmo-vomerine region is
always cartilaginous, but bears small teeth. The palato-pterygo-quadrate
bar is ossified and firmly united to the
cranium, and the mandible articulates directly with it (autostylic).
Membrane bones are freely developed in connection
with the mandible, dentary, splenial, and angular bones being
all present. There are two opercular bones.</p>

<p>In the extinct Dipteridae the cranium is very completely
covered with plates of dermal bone, and the skeleton in
general is more ossified than is the case in recent Dipnoi.</p>

<p>Six pairs of branchial arches occur in <i>Protopterus</i>; <i>Ceratodus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and <i>Lepidosiren</i> have five, like most other fish. The
branchial arches bear gill rakers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ribs.</span></p>

<p>As has been already mentioned (p. 24), although ribs
commonly appear to be the cut-off ends of the transverse processes,
they are really elements derived from the ventral or
haemal arch.</p>

<p>In Elasmobranchii and other cartilaginous fish they have
the form of small cartilaginous structures imperfectly separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
from the diverging halves of the ventral arch, and are often
absent.</p>

<p>In Teleostei and bony Ganoids they often have different attachments
in different parts of the body. In the tail region they
are not differentiated from the two halves of the ventral arch,
which meet in the middle line, and are prolonged into a
haemal spine. In the posterior trunk region they sometimes
form distinct processes diverging from the two halves of the
ventral arch; while further forward they may shift their
attachment so as to arise from the dorsal side of the two
halves of the ventral arch and at some distance from their
ends, which now diverge as ventri-lateral processes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pectoral girdle.</span></p>

<p>The simplest type of pectoral girdle is found in Elasmobranchs.
It is entirely cartilaginous and consists of a curved
ventrally-placed rod, ending dorsally in two horn-like scapular
processes which are sometimes attached to the cranium or
vertebral column. In Rays the shoulder girdle is very large,
and has a distinct suprascapular portion forming a broad plate
attached to the neural spines of the vertebrae. There is often
a cup-like glenoid cavity for the articulation of the limb; this
cavity is specially large in Rays and is much pierced by holes.
In Dipnoi the cartilaginous girdle still occurs, but on it there is
a deposit of membrane bone forming the clavicle, infraclavicle,
and supra-clavicle. These bones, which with the exception of
the clavicle, are unknown in higher vertebrates, are better
developed in Ganoids, and best of all in Teleosteans. They
are connected by the supratemporal with the epi-otic and
opisthotic regions of the cranium. Owing to this development
of dermal bone, the original cartilaginous arch becomes much
reduced, but ossifications representing the scapula and coracoid
occur in bony Ganoids and Teleosteans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelvic girdle.</span></p>

<p>In Elasmobranchs the pelvic girdle consists of a short
ventral rod of cartilage representing the ischium and pubis,
which does not send up dorsal iliac processes. In <i>Chimaera</i>
the pelvic girdle has a flattened pointed iliac portion, and
ventrally an unpaired movable cartilaginous plate which
bears hooks and is supposed to be copulatory in function.
Claspers of the usual type are present as well. The Dipnoi
have a primitive kind of pelvis in the form of a cartilaginous
plate lying in the mid-ventral line and drawn out into three
horns anteriorly. In Ganoids the pelvis has almost entirely
disappeared, though small cartilaginous vestiges of it remain
in <i>Polypterus</i>. In Teleosteans even these vestiges are gone,
and in these fish and Ganoids the place of the pelvis is taken
by the enlarged basi-pterygia (meta-pterygia) of the fins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paired fins</span><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>As regards the origin of the limbs or paired fins of fishes
there are two principal views. One view, that of Gegenbaur,
considers that limbs and their girdles are derived from visceral
arches which have migrated backwards. The other view, which
probably now has the greater number of supporters, considers
that the paired fins of fishes are of essentially the same nature
as the median fins.</p>

<p>According to Gegenbaur's view<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the <b>archipterygium</b> of
<i>Ceratodus</i> (fig. 20) represents the lowest type of fin; it consists
of a central cartilaginous axis bearing a large number of
radiale. The dorsal or pre-axial radiale are more numerous
than the ventral or postaxial, and at the margin of the fin<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cartilaginous endoskeletal radiale are replaced by horny exoskeletal
fin-rays.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to give a full discussion of the rival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
views, but some of the points which support Gegenbaur's view
may be mentioned. The fact that migration of visceral arches
has to be assumed is no difficulty, as it is obvious that
migration in the opposite direction has taken place in many
Teleosteans such as the Cod, whose pelvic fins are attached
to the throat in front of the pectorals. If migration did take
place, the pelvic fins being older than the pectoral should be
the more modified, and this is the case. Again, if the pectoral
girdle is a modified branchial arch, it must at some period
have carried a gill, and in <i>Protopterus</i> it does bear a vestigial
gill.</p>

<p>According to the view more prevalent at the present time,
the paired fins have been derived from two continuous folds
of skin and their skeletal supports running forward from the
anal region along the sides of the body, their character being
similar to the fold that gave rise to the median fins. In
support of this view it may be argued that the paired and
unpaired fins are often identical in structure, and that some
Elasmobranch embryos do show a ridge running between the
pectoral and pelvic fins. Then from this continuous fold two
pairs of smaller folds may have been specialised off, and in
each a number of cartilaginous radiale may have been developed.
The fin of <i>Cladoselache</i> from the Carboniferous of
Ohio apparently illustrates this condition. It consists of
certain basal pieces which do not project beyond the body
wall and bear a number of unsegmented cartilaginous radiale,
which show crowding together and are sometimes bifurcated
distally; they extend throughout the whole fin from the body
wall to the margin. From this fin the archipterygium might
be easily derived by the enlargement of one of the middle
radiale and the segmentation and partial fusion of them all.</p>

<p>Whether the archipterygium be a primitive or secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
type of fin, when it is once reached it is easy to derive all the
other types from it. The fins of the other living Dipnoi,&mdash;<i>Protopterus</i>
and <i>Lepidosiren</i>&mdash;are simply archipterygia from
which the radiale have almost or completely disappeared,
leaving only the segmented axes. Archipterygia too are found
in the pectoral fins of the Ichthyotomi, but the postaxial
radiale are much reduced.</p>

<p>The <b>ichthyopterygium</b>, or type of fin, characteristic of
many modern Elasmobranchs such as <i>Scyllium</i>, may have been
derived from the archipterygium by the gradual reduction of
the rays on the postaxial side of the axis and their condensation
on the pre-axial side. The Ichthyotomi such as <i>Xenacanthus</i>
show one stage in the reduction of the postaxial rays, and a
further stage is seen in the Notidanidae and some other sharks
like <i>Scymnus</i> and <i>Acanthias</i>, in which a few postaxial rays
still remain. The condensation of the pre-axial rays when
further continued leads to one of the rays getting an attachment
to the girdle. Thus the fin comes to articulate with the
girdle by two basalia or basal pieces; a third attachment is
formed in the same way and the three basalia are called respectively
pro-, meso-, and meta-pterygia. By some authors the
meta-pterygium and by others the meso-pterygium is regarded
as homologous with the axis of the archipterygium.</p>

<p>The pectoral fins of Elasmobranchs vary very much in
their mode of attachment. In some of the sharks, including
the Notidanidae and <i>Scyllium</i>, all three basalia articulate with
the pectoral girdle, while in others such as <i>Cestracion</i> the
meta-pterygium is excluded. In Rays the propterygium and
the meta-pterygium are long and narrow and diverge much
from one another; other basalia work their way in between
the meso-pterygium and meta-pterygium, and come to articulate
with the pectoral girdle. Sometimes they fuse and
form a second meso-pterygium. The radiale are greatly
elongated and are segmented.</p>

<p>In <i>Chimaera</i> all three basalia are present, but the meso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>-pterygium
is shifted and does not articulate with the pectoral
girdle<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>In <i>Acipenser</i> and <i>Polyodon</i> the pectoral fin is built on the
same type as in Elasmobranchs, but becomes modified from the
fact that the propterygium is replaced by dermal bone which
forms a large <b>marginal ray</b>. Extra meso-pterygia are formed
in the same way as in Rays.</p>

<p>In <i>Polypterus</i> the pro-and meta-pterygia have ossified
while the meso-pterygium remains chiefly cartilaginous; the
fin-rays are also chiefly ossified.</p>

<p>In <i>Amia</i>, <i>Lepidosteus</i>, and certain Teleosteans like <i>Salmo</i>,
not only the propterygium but the meso-pterygium is almost
suppressed by the marginal ray.</p>

<p>In the great majority of Teleosteans a still further stage is
reached, the endoskeletal elements, the basalia and radiale
are almost entirely suppressed and the fin comes to consist
entirely of ossified fin-rays of dermal origin.</p>

<p>In some Teleosteans&mdash;<i>Exocaetus</i>, a herring, and <i>Dactylopterus</i>,
a gurnard&mdash;the pectoral fins are so enormously developed
that by means of them the fish is able to fly through the air
for considerable distances. The skeleton of these great fins is
almost entirely composed of dermal bone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelvic fin.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic fin is almost always further removed from the
archipterygial condition, and is in general more modified than is
the pectoral. Thus in the Ichthyotomi, while the pectoral fins
are archipterygia similar to those of <i>Ceratodus</i>, the pelvic fins
consist of an axis bearing rays on the postaxial side only, and
prolonged distally into a clasper. In Dipnoi however the
pelvic fins are very similar to the pectoral. In Elasmobranchs
the meso-pterygium is missing, the propterygium is small or
absent, and the fin is mainly composed of the meta-pterygium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
(generally called basi-pterygium) and its radiale. The males
in Elasmobranchii and Holocephali have the distal end of the
meta-pterygium prolonged into a clasper.</p>

<p>In Ganoids and in Teleosteans the loss of the pelvic girdle
causes the pelvic fin to be still further removed from the
primitive state. There is always a large basi-pterygium which
lies imbedded in the muscles and meets its fellow at its proximal
end. In Cartilaginous Ganoids it has a secondary segmentation.
Its relation to its fellow is subject to much variation
in Teleosteans, sometimes as in the Perch the two are in
contact throughout, sometimes as in the Salmon they meet
distally as well as proximally, but are elsewhere separated by
a space, sometimes as in the Pike and Bony Ganoids they
diverge widely. The radiale are articulated to the basi-pterygium.
In Cartilaginous Ganoids and <i>Polypterus</i> they
are well developed, in other Ganoids and in Teleosteans they
are in the main replaced by dermal fin-rays.</p>

<p>In some Teleosteans such as the Cod the pelvic fins have
migrated from their usual position and come to be attached
to the throat in front of the pectoral fins. Fish with this
arrangement are grouped together as <b>jugulares</b>.</p>

<small>CLASS II. AMPHIBIA<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amphibia</span> differ markedly from Pisces in the fact that
in the more abundant and familiar forms the skin is naked,
and that when the integument is prolonged into median fins
they are devoid of fin-rays. The notochord may persist, but
bony vertebral centra are always developed. These are sometimes
biconcave, sometimes procoelous, sometimes opisthocoelous.
There is only one sacral vertebra, except in rare
cases. The cartilaginous cranium persists to a considerable
extent but is more or less replaced by cartilage bone, and
overlain by membrane bone. The basi-occipital is not completely
ossified, and the skull articulates with the vertebral
column by means of two occipital condyles formed by the
exoccipitals.</p>

<p>There is a large parasphenoid, but there are no ossifications
in the basisphenoidal, presphenoidal, and alisphenoidal regions.
In most cases the epi-otics and opisthotics are ossified
continuously with the exoccipitals.</p>

<p>The palato-pterygo-quadrate bar is firmly united to the
cranium, so the skull is autostylic. The palatines and
pterygoids are membrane bones. Teeth are nearly always
borne on the vomers and commonly on the maxillae and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
premaxillae. There are no sternal ribs, and the sternum is
very intimately related to the pectoral girdle. There are no
obturator foramina. The limbs are as in the higher vertebrata,
divisible into upper arm, fore-arm, and manus (wrist
and hand), and into thigh, shin, and pes (ankle and foot)
respectively. The posterior limb is, as a rule, pentedactylate,
but in nearly every case the pollex is vestigial or absent.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 1.</i> <span class="smcap">Urodela<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</span></p>

<p>The Urodela are elongated animals with a naked skin, a
persistent tail, and generally four short limbs.</p>

<p>The vertebral centra are opisthocoelous or biconcave, and
there are numerous precaudal vertebrae. Portions of the
notochord commonly persist in the intervertebral spaces. In
the skull there is no sphenethmoid forming a ring encircling
the anterior end of the brain, its place being in many cases
partly taken by a pair of orbitosphenoids. There is no
quadratojugal, and the quadrate is more or less ossified. The
mandible has a distinct splenial, and the articular is ossified.</p>

<p>There is no definite tympanic cavity. The hyoid apparatus
is throughout life connected to the quadrate by ligament, and
a large basilingual plate does not occur. The ribs are short
structures with bifurcated proximal ends. In the pelvis the
pubis remains cartilaginous, and there is a bifid cartilaginous
epipubis. The bones of the fore-arm and shin remain distinct,
and the manus never has more than four digits.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Ichthyoidea.</span></p>

<p>The vertebrae are amphicoelous, but the notochord remains
but little constricted throughout the whole length of
the vertebral column. Three or four branchial arches nearly
always persist in the adult. The cartilages of the carpus
and tarsus remain unossified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ichthyoidea may be subdivided again into two
groups:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. <i>Perennibranchiata</i>, whose chief distinguishing skeletal
characters are that the skull is elongated, the premaxillae are
not ankylosed, the maxillae are vestigial or absent; there are
sometimes no nasals, and the palatines bear teeth;</p>

<p class="cen">e.g. <i>Siren</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Menobranchus</i>.</p>

<p>B. <i>Derotremata</i>, whose chief distinguishing skeletal characters
are that there are large maxillae and nasals; teeth are
borne by both maxillae and premaxillae; there are no palatines;
and both pectoral and pelvic limbs are always present;</p>

<p>e.g. <i>Amphiuma</i>, <i>Megalobatrachus</i>, <i>Cryptobranchus</i>.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Salamandrina.</span></p>

<p>The vertebrae are opisthocoelous. The skull is broad, and
teeth are borne by both premaxillae and dentaries. Nasal
bones are present. The remains of only two branchial arches
are found in the adult. The carpus and tarsus are more or
less ossified.</p>

<p>This suborder includes the Newts (<i>Molge</i>), Salamanders
(<i>Salamandra</i>), and <i>Amblystoma</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> 2. <span class="smcap">Labyrinthodontia<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</span></p>

<p>These are extinct Amphibia with a greatly developed
dermal exoskeleton, which is generally limited to the ventral
surface. The body and tail are long and in some cases limbs
are absent. The teeth are pointed and often have the dentine
remarkably folded. The vertebrae are amphicoelous, and are
generally well ossified. The skull is very solid, and has a
greatly-developed secondary roof which hides the true cranium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and is very little broken up by fossae. Paired dermal supra-occipitals
are found, and there is an interparietal foramen.
The epi-otics and opisthotics form a pair of bones distinct from
the exoccipitals. Four simple limbs of moderate length are
generally present, and in some cases all four limbs are pentedactylate.
Among the better known genera of Labyrinthodonts
are <i>Mastodonsaurus</i>, <i>Nyrania</i>, and <i>Archegosaurus</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 3.</i> <span class="smcap">Gymnophiona<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</span></p>

<p>These animals form a group of abnormal worm-like Amphibia
having an exoskeleton in the form of subcutaneous
scales arranged in rings. The vertebrae are biconcave and are
very numerous; very few however belong to the tail. The
skull has a complete secondary bony roof, the mandible
bears teeth and has an enormous backward projection of the
angular. The hyoid arch has very slender cornua and no
distinct body, it is attached neither to the cranium nor to
the suspensorium. The ribs are very long and there are no
limbs or limb girdles.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 4.</i> <span class="smcap">Anura.</span></p>

<p>These are tailless Amphibia, which except in a few instances,
are devoid of an exoskeleton. The vertebrae are as
a rule procoelous, and are very few in number. The post-sacral
part of the spinal column ossifies continuously, forming
an unsegmented cylindrical rod, the urostyle. Remains of the
notochord persist, lying <i>vertebrally</i>, i.e. enclosed within the
centra of the several vertebrae, and not as in Urodela lying
between one vertebra and the next. The skull is very short
and wide. The mandible is almost always, if not invariably,
toothless.</p>

<p>The frontals and parietals on each side are united so as to
form a pair of fronto-parietals, and a girdle-like sphenethmoid
is present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The quadrate is not generally ossified. A predentary or
mento-meckelian bone is commonly present in the mandible,
and a single bone represents the angular and splenial. The
branchial arches are much reduced in the adult, and the distal
ends of the cornua unite to form a flat basilingual plate of a
comparatively large size.</p>

<p>Ribs are very little developed. Clavicles are present.
The ilia are very greatly elongated. The anterior limb has
four well-developed digits and a vestigial pollex, and is of
moderate length; the radius and ulna have fused. The
posterior limb is greatly elongated and is pentedactylate; the
tibia and fibula are fused, while the calcaneum and astragalus
are greatly elongated, and it is largely owing to them that
the length of the limb is so great. The group includes the
Frogs and Toads, the predominant Amphibia of the present
time.</p>

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE NEWT (<i>Molge cristata</i>).</small></h2>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The skin of the Newt is quite devoid of any exoskeletal
structures. The only exoskeletal structures that the animal
possesses are the teeth, and these are most conveniently described
with the endoskeleton.</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton of the Newt, though ossified to a considerable
extent, is more cartilaginous than is that of the frog.
It is divisible into an <b>axial portion</b> including the vertebral
column, skull, ribs, and sternum, and an <b>appendicular portion</b>
including the skeleton of the limbs and their girdles.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral column.</span></p>

<p>This consists of about fifty vertebrae arranged in a regular
continuous series. The first vertebra differs a good deal from
any of the others; the seventeenth or sacral vertebra and the
eighteenth or first caudal also present peculiarities of their
own. The remaining vertebrae are divided by the sacrum
into an anterior series of <b>trunk</b> vertebrae which bear fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
large ribs, and a posterior series of <b>caudal</b> vertebrae, all of
which except the first few are ribless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The trunk vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>Any vertebra from the second to the sixteenth may be
taken as a type of the trunk vertebrae.</p>

<p>The general form is elongated and somewhat hour-glass
shaped, and the <b>centra</b> are convex in front and concave
behind; an opisthocoelous condition such as this is quite exceptional
in Anura. The <b>notochord</b> may persist intervertebrally<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>,
but in the centre of each vertebra it becomes greatly
constricted or altogether obliterated, and replaced by marrow.
The superficial portion of the centrum is ossified, while the
articular surfaces are cartilaginous. The <b>neural arches</b> are
low and articulate together by means of <b>zygapophyses</b> borne
on short diverging processes. The anterior zygapophyses look
upwards, the posterior downwards. Each neural arch is drawn
out dorsally into a very slight cartilaginous <b>neural spine</b>.</p>

<p>On each centrum, at a little behind the middle line, there
arise a pair of short backwardly-directed <b>transverse processes</b>;
each of which becomes divided into two slightly
divergent portions, a dorsal portion which meets the tubercular
process of the rib and is derived from the neural arch, and a
ventral portion which meets the capitular process of the rib
and is derived from the ventral or haemal arch. The division
between these two parts of the transverse processes can be
traced back as far as the sacrum.</p>

<p>The <b>first vertebra</b> as already mentioned differs much
from all the others. It has no ribs, and presents anteriorly
two slightly divergent concave surfaces which articulate with
the occipital condyles of the skull. Between these surfaces
the dorsal portion of the anterior face of the centrum is
drawn out into a prominent <b>odontoid process</b>, the occurrence
of which renders it probable that the first vertebra of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the newt is really the axis, and that the atlas with the exception
of the odontoid process has become fused with the skull.
The sacral vertebra or <b>sacrum</b> differs from the vertebrae
immediately in front of it only in the fact that its transverse
processes are stouter and more obviously divided into dorsal
and ventral portions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The caudal vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>caudal vertebrae</b> are about twenty-four in number.
The anterior ones have hour-glass shaped centra, and short
backwardly-directed transverse processes. The middle and
posterior ones have rather shorter centra, and are without
transverse processes. The neural arches resemble those of the
trunk vertebrae, but each is drawn out into a rather high
cartilaginous neural spine abruptly truncated anteriorly. All
the caudal vertebrae except the first have also a haemal arch,
which is very similar to the neural arch, and is drawn out
into a haemal spine quite similar to the neural spine. Both
neural and haemal arches are ossified continuously with the
centra.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>The skull of the newt is divisible into three principal
parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) an axial part, the <b>cranium proper</b>, which encloses
the brain and to which</p>

<p>(2) the <b>capsules</b> of the <b>auditory and olfactory sense
organs</b> are fused;</p>

<p>(3) the skeleton of the <b>jaws and hyoid apparatus</b>.
The skull is much flattened and expanded, though not so much
as in the frog.</p>

<p>(1) <span class="smcap">The cranium proper.</span></p>

<p>The <b>cranium proper</b> or <b>brain case</b> is an unsegmented
tube which remains partly cartilaginous, and is partly converted
into cartilage bone, partly sheathed by membrane bone.
The roof and floor of the cartilaginous cranium are, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the case also in the frog, pierced by holes or fontanelles, and
these are so large that the main part of the roof and floor
comes to be formed by membrane bone.</p>

<p>Two pairs of large ossifications take place in the cranial
walls. Of these the more posterior on each side represents
the <b>exoccipital</b> and all three <b>periotic</b> bones. It bears a
small convex patch of cartilage for articulation with the atlas,
and with its fellow forms the boundary of the foramen magnum.</p>

<p>Two foramina pierce the exoccipital just in front of the
occipital condyle and transmit respectively the glossopharyngeal
and pneumogastric (fig. 21, X) nerves. Lying laterally to
these nerve openings is seen a patch of cartilage, the <b>stapes</b>,
which is homologous with the stapes or proximal element of
the columellar chain in the frog. Further forward in front of
the stapes is the small opening for the exit of the facial nerve,
and seen in a lateral view close to the orbitosphenoid, that
for the trigeminal (fig. 21, C, 5).</p>

<p>In front of these large bones the lateral parts of the
cranial walls remain cartilaginous for a short distance, and
then there follow two elongated bones, the <b>orbitosphenoids</b>
(fig. 21, B and C, 11), pierced by the foramina for the exit
of the optic nerves. These bones partly correspond to the
sphenethmoid of the frog.</p>

<p>The <i>membrane bones</i> connected with the cranium are the
<i>parietals</i>, <i>frontals</i> and <i>prefronto-lachrymals</i> on the dorsal
surface, and the <i>parasphenoid</i> on the ventral surface.</p>

<p>The <i>parietals</i> (fig. 21, A and C, 6) roof over the posterior
part of the great dorsal fontanelle and overlap the exoccipito-periotics.
They meet one another along a sinuous suture in
the middle line, as do also the <i>frontals</i> which overlap them
in front. The <i>frontals</i> and <i>parietals</i> both extend for a short
distance down the sides of the cranium and meet the orbitosphenoids.
The <i>prefronto-lachrymals</i> (fig. 21, A and C, 7)
connect the frontals with the maxillae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

</table></div></div>

<p>On the ventral surface is the large <i>parasphenoid</i> (fig. 21,
B, 10), which is widest behind and overlapped anteriorly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
by the vomero-palatines.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">The sense capsules.</span></p>

<p>The <b>auditory capsules</b> become almost completely ossified
continuously with the exoccipitals; they have been already
described.</p>

<p>The <b>nasal capsules</b> are large and quite unossified though
they are overlain by membrane bone. They appear on the
dorsal surface between the anterior nares and the nasal process
of the premaxillae. They enclose the nasal organs, bound
the inner side of the anterior narial opening, and are connected
with one another posteriorly by a cartilaginous area.</p>

<p>Developed in connection with the nasal capsules are a pair
of rather large <i>nasals</i> (fig. 21, A and C, 4), which lie on the
dorsal surface immediately in front of the frontals. Each
forms part of the posterior boundary of one of the anterior
nares, and the two are separated from one another in
the middle line by the nasal process of the premaxillae
(fig. 21, A, 1), and the opening of the <b>middle narial passage</b>
(fig. 21, A and B, 22), which passes right through the skull.</p>

<p>On the ventral surface of the skull and forming the greater
part of the boundary of the posterior nares are two large
bones, the <i>vomero-palatines</i> (fig. 21, B and C, 9). Each consists
of a wide anterior portion, partly separated from its fellow in
the middle line by the ventral opening of the middle narial
passage, and of a long pointed posterior portion which is
separated from its fellow by the <i>parasphenoid</i>, and bears a row
of small pointed teeth formed of dentine capped with enamel.</p>

<p>(3) <span class="smcap">The jaws.</span></p>

<p>The <b>upper jaw</b> of the newt is a discontinuous structure
divided into two parts, an anterior part which consists of
membrane bones, the <i>maxillae</i> and <i>premaxillae</i>, and a posterior
part which remains mainly cartilaginous.</p>

<p>The <i>premaxillae</i> are united, forming a single bone, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a ventral view is seen to meet the maxillae and vomero-palatines,
and in a dorsal view to send back a nasal process
(fig. 21, A, 1) between the nasals.</p>

<p>The <i>maxillae</i> are large bones, each terminating in a point
posteriorly. A single row of teeth similar to those on the
vomero-palatines runs along the outer margin of the maxillae
and premaxillae.</p>

<p>The posterior part of the upper jaw forms a mass of
cartilage which extends forwards towards the maxillae as a
long pointed process whose ventral surface and sides are overlapped
by a membrane bone, the <i>pterygoid</i> (fig. 21, 12).</p>

<p>The suspensorial bones include the <b>quadrate</b> and <i>squamosal</i>.
The <b>quadrate</b> (fig. 21, 15) which forms the true
<b>suspensorium</b> is directed forwards and outwards, and is
terminated by a patch of cartilage with which the mandible
articulates.</p>

<p>The lower jaw or mandible remains partly cartilaginous,
while its ossifications include two membrane bones and one
cartilage bone. The cartilage bone is the <b>articular</b> (fig. 21, C,
18), it forms the posterior part of the ramus, extends forwards
for some distance along its inner side, and is terminated
posteriorly by a patch of cartilage which articulates with the
quadrate. The <i>dentary</i> (fig. 21, C, 20) is a large bone which forms
the anterior part and nearly all the outer half of each ramus,
and bears teeth similar to those of the upper jaw. Attached
to its inner face is a long slender <i>splenial</i> (fig. 21, C, 21).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Hyoid apparatus.</span></p>

<p>This consists of the hyoid arch and part of the first two
branchial arches.</p>

<p>The <b>hyoid arch</b> (fig. 29, A, 2) consists of a pair of <b>cornua</b>,
each of which is divided into two halves. The dorsal half
forming the <b>cerato-hyal</b> is mainly ossified though tipped with
cartilage, and is connected by ligament with the suspensorium.
The ventral half (<b>hypo-hyal</b>) is cartilaginous, and is connected
with the basibranchial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>branchial arches</b> consist of a median piece, the
<b>basibranchial</b>, which is ossified in the centre and cartilaginous
at either end, and of two pairs of <b>cerato-branchials</b>
which are attached to the cartilaginous part (fig. 29, A, 8)
of the basibranchial. The first cerato-branchial is chiefly
ossified, the second (fig. 29, A, 4) is a good deal smaller and
is cartilaginous. Both are united dorsally to a single <b>epi-branchial</b>,
which is terminated by a small cartilaginous area
at the free end but is elsewhere well ossified.</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Ribs.</span></p>

<p>The ribs are short imperfectly ossified structures, bifid
at their proximal end where they articulate with the transverse
processes, and tipped both proximally and distally with
cartilage. The dorsal portion of the proximal end corresponds
to the <b>tuberculum</b> of the ribs of higher animals, and the
ventral portion to the <b>capitulum</b>. Some of the anterior ribs
have a step-like notch on their dorsal surfaces.</p>

<p>The second to twelfth ribs are fairly equal in size, but
further back they decrease slightly. The ribs which connect
the sacral vertebrae with the ilia are however large. The short
ribs borne on the anterior caudal vertebrae are cartilaginous.</p>

<p>D. <span class="smcap">The Sternum.</span></p>

<p>The sternum (fig. 22, A, 6) is a rather broad plate of
cartilage, drawn out posteriorly into a median process marked
by a prominent ridge. On its antero-lateral margins it bears
surfaces for articulation with the pectoral girdle.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Pectoral girdle.</span></p>

<p>This is of a very simple character, and remains throughout
life in an imperfectly ossified condition. It consists of a
dorsal <b>scapular portion</b>, and a ventral <b>coracoid portion</b>
partially divided into an anterior part, the precoracoid, and
a posterior part, the <b>coracoid</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22. A ventral, and B lateral view of the shoulder girdle

</table></div></div>

<p>The <b>scapular portion</b> is a slightly curved oblong plate; its
proximal third the <b>scapula</b> (fig. 22, 1) is ossified and bounds
part of the well-marked <b>glenoid cavity</b> (fig. 22, 4); its distal
portion forms a large oblong cartilaginous plate, the <ins class="mynote"  title="missing text"><b>suprascapula</b> (fig. 22, 2).</ins></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>precoracoid</b> (fig. 22, 5) forms a small forwardly-directed
cartilaginous plate. The <b>coracoid</b> (fig. 22, 3) forms
a much larger plate, the greater part of which is unossified
and overlaps its fellow in the middle line, the two being overlapped
by the sternum. Around the glenoid cavity is an area
which is mainly ossified and is continuous with the scapula.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Anterior limb.</span></p>

<p>This is divisible into three parts, the <b>upper arm</b> or
<b>brachium</b>, the <b>fore-arm</b> or <b>antibrachium</b>, and the <b>manus</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>upper arm</b> includes a single bone, the <b>humerus</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>humerus</b> is a slender bone cylindrical in the middle
and expanded at either end, the proximal part forms a
rounded <b>head</b> which articulates with the glenoid cavity.
Along the proximal part of the anterior or pre-axial surface
runs a strong <b>deltoid ridge</b>. The proximal part of the postaxial
surface also bears a small outgrowth.</p>

<p>The <b>fore-arm</b> contains two bones, the <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b>, both
of which are small and imperfectly ossified at their terminations.</p>

<p>The <b>radius</b> (fig. 23, B, 11) or pre-axial bone is rather
the larger of the two, and is considerably expanded at its
proximal end. The <b>ulna</b> or postaxial bone is somewhat
expanded distally, but is not drawn out proximally into an
olecranon process.</p>

<p>The <b>manus</b> consists of two parts, a group of small bones
forming the <b>carpus</b> or <b>wrist</b>, and the <b>hand</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>carpus</b> is in a very simple unmodified condition as
compared with that of the Frog. It consists of a proximal
row of two bones and a distal row of four, with one, the
<b>centrale</b>, interposed between. All these bones are small and
polygonal and are imbedded in a plate of cartilage.</p>

<p>The bones of the proximal row are a smaller pre-axial bone,
the <b>radiale</b> (fig. 23, B, 13), and a larger postaxial bone, which
represents the fused <b>ulnare</b> and <b>intermedium</b> of the very
simple carpus described on pp. 26 and 27.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The four bones of the distal row are respectively <b>carpalia</b>
2, 3, 4 and 5.</p>

<p>The <b>hand</b> consists of four digits, that corresponding to
the thumb of the human hand, judging from the analogy of
the frog probably being the one that is absent.</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>Each digit consists of a somewhat elongated <b>metacarpal</b>
and of two or three phalanges. The metacarpals are contracted
in the middle and expanded at either end. They are connected
with the carpus by cartilage, and the articulations between the
several phalanges, and between the metacarpals and phalanges
are also cartilaginous. The second, third, and fifth digits
have two phalanges apiece, the fourth, which is the longest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
has three. The second metacarpal in the specimen examined
and figured articulates partly with carpale 2, partly with
carpale 3.</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Pelvic girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic girdle of the Newt is in a much less modified
condition than is that of the Frog (see p. 165). It consists
of a dorsal element, the <b>ilium</b>, a posterior ventral element,
the <b>ischium</b>, and an anterior ventral element, the <b>pubis</b>, to
which is attached an <b>epipubis</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>ilium</b> is a somewhat cylindrical bone which at its
ventral end meets the ischium, and forms part of the <b>acetabulum</b>.
It is then directed upwards and slightly backwards,
and is attached to the ribs of the sacral vertebra.</p>

<p>The <b>ischia</b> are a pair of somewhat square bones which
meet one another in the middle line; they form part of the
acetabulum, and are united to the ilia above.</p>

<p>In front of the ischia is a narrow cartilaginous area which
represents the <b>pubes</b>. Projecting forwards from it is a bifid
cartilaginous <b>epipubis</b>.</p>

<p>D. <span class="smcap">The Posterior limb.</span></p>

<p>This is divisible into a proximal portion, the <b>thigh</b>, a
middle portion, the <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b>, and a distal portion, the
<b>pes</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>thigh</b> consists of a single bone, the <b>femur</b> (fig. 23, A, 1),
which has a thin shaft and expanded ends. The anterior
part of the pre-axial border and posterior part of the postaxial
border bear slight outgrowths.</p>

<p>The <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b> includes two short bones, the <b>tibia</b> and
<b>fibula</b>, which are nearly equal in length. The pre-axial bone
or tibia is a straight bone thickest at its proximal end, the
postaxial bone or <b>fibula</b> (fig. 23, A, 3) is a rather stouter
curved bone of nearly equal diameter throughout.</p>

<p>The <b>pes</b> includes the <b>tarsus</b> or <b>ankle</b>, and the <b>foot</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>tarsus</b> consists of eight small bones arranged in a
proximal row of three, the <b>tibiale</b>, <b>intermedium</b> and <b>fibulare</b>,
and a distal row of four <b>tarsalia</b>, with one bone, the
<b>centrale</b> (fig. 23, A, 7), interposed between the two rows.
In the specimen examined, the <b>tibiale</b>, is a small bone
articulating with the tibia, the <b>intermedium</b> (fig. 23, A, 5)
is larger and articulates with both tibia and fibula, the
<b>fibulare</b> is the largest of the three and articulates with the
fibula.</p>

<p>The bones of the distal row are <b>tarsalia 1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and a
bone representing <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> fused. In the specimen examined
tarsale 1 is pushed away dorsally (fig. 23, A, 8), so as to lie
between the tibiale and tarsale 2. All the tarsal bones are
small and somewhat polygonal, and are connected with one
another, and with the tibia and fibula on the one hand, and
with the metatarsals on the other by a thin layer of cartilage.</p>

<p>The five <b>digits</b> of the foot each consist of a <b>metatarsal</b>
and of a certain number of <b>phalanges</b>. In the specimen
examined, owing to the shifting of tarsale 1, the first metatarsal
as well as the second articulates with tarsale 2, while
the fifth metatarsal articulates partially with the bone representing
the fused tarsalia 4 and 5, partially with the fibulare.
All the bones of the digits except the distal phalanges are
terminated at each end by cartilaginous epiphyses, the distal
phalanx of each digit has a cartilaginous epiphysis only on its
proximal end.</p>

<p>The first, second, and fifth digits have two phalanges
apiece, the third and fourth have three.</p>

<p>Figure 31 B, showing a Newt's tarsus copied from Gegenbaur,
has precisely the arrangement generally regarded as
primitive for the higher vertebrates, except that tarsalia 4
and 5 are fused.</p>

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE
FROG<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
(<i>Rana temporaria</i>).</small></h2>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The skin of the frog is smooth and quite devoid of scales
or other exoskeletal structures. The only exoskeletal structures
met with in the frog are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <b>teeth</b>, which are most conveniently described with
the endoskeleton.</p>

<p>2. The horny covering of the calcar or prehallux (see
p. 167).</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton of the adult frog consists partly of
cartilage, partly of bone and each of these types of tissue
occurs in two forms. The cartilage may be hyaline, as in
the omosternum and xiphisternum, or may be more or less
calcified as in part of the suprascapula and the epiphyses
of the limb bones. The bone may be cartilage bone, or
membrane bone.</p>

<p>The skeleton is divisible into an <b>axial portion</b> consisting
of the skull, vertebral column, and sternum, and an <b>appen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>dicular
portion</b> consisting of the skeleton of the limbs and
their girdles.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral column.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral column is a tube, formed of a series of ten
bones which surround and protect the spinal cord. Of these
ten bones nine are vertebrae, while the tenth is a straight rod,
the <b>urostyle</b>, and is almost as long as all the vertebrae put
together. The second to eighth vertebrae inclusive have a very
similar structure, but the first and ninth differ from the others.</p>

<p>Any one of the second to eighth vertebrae forms a bony
ring with a somewhat thickened floor, the <b>centrum</b> or body,
which articulates with the centra of the immediately preceding
and succeeding vertebrae. The articulating surfaces are
covered with cartilage and are procoelous, or convex in front
and concave behind. The eighth vertebra is however amphicoelous
or biconcave. The centrum of each vertebra encloses
an isolated vestige of the notochord. The <b>neural arch</b> forms
the roof and sides of the neural canal, which is very spacious
in the anterior vertebrae, but becomes more depressed in the
posterior ones. The arch bears the <b>neural spine</b>, a low
median ridge of variable character, and is drawn out in
front and behind, forming the two pairs of articulating
surfaces or <b>zygapophyses</b> by means of which the vertebrae
are attached together. Of these the anterior articulating
surfaces or <b>prezygapophyses</b> look upwards and slightly
inwards, while the posterior articulating surfaces or <b>postzygapophyses</b>
look downwards and slightly outwards. The
sides of the neural arches are drawn out into a pair of
prominent <b>transverse processes</b>. Those of the second
vertebra look somewhat forwards, those of the third look
directly outwards or somewhat forwards, while those of
the fourth, fifth, and sixth are directed slightly backwards,
and those of the seventh and eighth nearly straight outwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
All the transverse processes are terminated by very small cartilaginous
<b>ribs</b>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Special vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>first vertebra</b> is a ring-like structure with a much
depressed centrum. It bears in front two oval concave surfaces
for articulation with the condyles of the skull, while the
centrum is terminated behind by a prominent convex surface.
There are as a rule no transverse processes, and the postzygapophyses
look downwards and outwards. Occasionally
however transverse processes do occur. Projecting forwards
from the centrum is a minute process better developed in the
Newt. This resembles an odontoid process, and it has hence
been supposed that the first vertebra is homologous with the
axis of mammalia, and that the atlas of the frog is fused with
the skull.</p>

<p>The <b>ninth vertebra</b> has very stout transverse processes
directed backwards and somewhat upwards. They articulate
with the pelvic girdle and hence this vertebra is regarded as
the <b>sacrum</b>. The neural arch is much depressed, the centrum
is convex in front and bears on its posterior surface two short
rounded processes for articulation with the urostyle.</p>

<p>The <b>urostyle</b> is a long rod-like bone forming the posterior
unsegmented continuation of the vertebral column. It is
probably equivalent to three vertebrae, the tenth, eleventh,
and twelfth fused together, and to an unsegmented rod of
cartilage which lies ventral to the notochord. The anterior end
is expanded and bears two concave articular surfaces by means
of which it articulates with the sacrum. A prominent ridge
runs along the dorsal surface, but gradually diminishes when
traced back. The anterior portion contains a canal which is
a continuation of the neural canal. At a point not far from
the anterior end, this canal communicates with the exterior
by a pair of minute holes which correspond with the intervertebral
foramina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Skull<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</span></p>

<p>The skull of the Frog consists of three principal parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) an axial part, the <b>cranium proper</b>, which encloses
the brain. To it are firmly fused</p>

<p>(2) the <b>capsules of the olfactory and auditory
sense organs</b>,</p>

<p>(3) lastly there is the <b>hyoid apparatus</b> and the <b>skeleton
of the jaws</b>.</p>

<p>The skull is by no means so completely ossified as is the
vertebral column, but in addition to the cartilage bone, there
is a great development of membrane bone in connection
with it.</p>

<p>The skull has a peculiarly flattened and expanded form
depending on the wide lateral separation of the jaws from the
cranium.</p>


<p>(1) <span class="smcap">The Cranium proper</span> or Brain case.</p>

<p>This is an unsegmented tube, which is widest behind. It
remains to a considerable extent cartilaginous, but is partly
converted into cartilage bone, partly sheathed in membrane
bone. Its roof is imperfect, being pierced by three holes
or <b>fontanelles</b>, one large anterior fontanelle (fig. 25, A, 9),
and two smaller posterior fontanelles (fig. 25, A, 10).</p>

<p>The cartilage bones of the cranium proper are the two
<b>exoccipitals</b> and the <b>sphenethmoid</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>exoccipitals</b> (figs. 24, 25, and 26, 6) are a pair of
irregular bones bounding the foramen magnum at the posterior
end of the skull. They almost completely surround the foramen
magnum, and bear a pair of oval convex surfaces, the <b>occipital
condyles</b>, with which the first vertebra articulates. The bones
generally called the exoccipitals of the frog include the <b>epi-otic</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and <b>opisthotic</b> elements of many skulls, in addition to the
exoccipitals.</p>

<p>The patch of unossified cartilage immediately external to
the occipital condyle is pierced by two small foramina, through
which the ninth and tenth nerves leave the cranial cavity.
The ninth nerve passes through the more external of these
foramina, the tenth through the one nearer the condyle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The foramina lie however very close together and are sometimes
confluent. The cranial walls for a considerable distance
in front of the occipitals are unossified, but the anterior end
of the cranial cavity is encircled by another cartilage bone, the
<b>sphenethmoid</b> (figs. 24 and 25, 1) or girdle bone. This
partly corresponds to the orbitosphenoids of the Newt's skull.
Anteriorly it is pierced by a pair of small foramina through
which the ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve pass out.</p>

<p>The anterior part of the cranial cavity is divided into two
halves by a vertical plate, the <b>mesethmoid</b>. Some little
distance behind the sphenethmoid the ventro-lateral walls of
the cartilaginous cranium are pierced by a pair of rather prominent
holes, the <b>optic foramina</b> (figs. 24 and 25, B, II), and
at a similar distance further back, occupying a kind of notch
in the pro-otic are the large <b>trigeminal foramina</b>, through
which the fifth and seventh nerves leave the cranium. Between
the trigeminal and optic foramina are the very small foramina
for the sixth nerves (fig. 25, B, <span class="smcap">VI</span>).</p>

<p>The <i>membrane bones</i> of the cranium proper include the
<i>fronto-parietals</i> and the <i>parasphenoid</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>fronto-parietals</i> (figs. 24 and 26, A, 2) form a pair of
long flat bones closely applied to one another in the middle line,
the line of junction being the <b>sagittal suture</b>. They cover
over the fontanelles and overlap the sphenethmoid in front.</p>

<p>The <i>parasphenoid</i> (figs. 24 and 26, B, 7) is a bone shaped
like a dagger with a very short handle. It lies on the ventral
surface of the cranium, the blade being directed forwards and
underlying the sphenethmoid; its lateral processes underlie
the auditory capsules.</p>


<p>(2) <span class="smcap">The sense capsules.</span></p>

<p>The sense capsules are cartilaginous or bony structures
which surround the olfactory and auditory organs and are
closely united to the cranium.</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>The <b>auditory capsules</b> are fused with the sides of the
posterior end of the cranium just in front of the exoccipitals.
They are largely cartilaginous, but include in their anterior
walls a pair of irregular cartilage bones, the <b>pro-otics</b> (figs.
24 and 25, 8). The cartilaginous area lying ventral to the
pro-otic and external to the exoccipital is pierced by a rather
prominent hole, the <b>fenestra ovalis</b>, which forms a communication
between the internal ear cavity, and a space the
tympanic cavity, which lies at the side of the head, and is
bounded externally by the tympanic membrane. The fenestra
ovalis is occupied by a minute cartilaginous structure, the
<b>stapes</b>, and articulated partly to this and partly to a slight
recess in the pro-otic is the <b>columella</b> (fig. 25, B, 5), a rod in
part bony and in part cartilaginous, whose outer end is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
attached to the tympanic membrane. The columella and
stapes are together homologous with the mammalian auditory
ossicles and with the hyomandibular of Elasmobranchs. Sometimes
the term columella is used to include the whole ossicular
chain,&mdash;the columella together with the stapes.</p>

<p>The <b>olfactory</b> or <b>nasal capsules</b> (fig. 25, B, 12) are fused
with the anterior end of the cranium and differ from the
auditory capsules in being to a great extent unossified. There
are however two pairs of membrane bones developed in connection
with them, the <i>vomers</i> and the <i>nasals</i>. They are drawn
out into three pairs of cartilaginous processes, on the dorsal
surface into the <b>prenasal</b> and <b>alinasal</b> processes which bound
the external nares, and on the ventral surface towards the
middle line into the forwardly-projecting <b>rhinal</b> processes.</p>

<p>The <i>nasals</i> (figs. 24 and 26, 11) form a pair of triangular
bones lying dorsolaterally in front of the fronto-parietals.
Their bases are turned towards one another and their apices
are directed outwards and backwards. They correspond in
position with the prefrontals of the reptilian skull as well as
with the nasals.</p>

<p>The <i>vomers</i> are a pair of irregular bones lying on the
ventral surface of the olfactory capsules. Each bears on
its inner and posterior angle a group of minute pointed teeth,
while its outer border is drawn out into three or four small
slightly diverging processes, the two posterior of which form
the inner boundary of the <b>posterior nares</b> (fig. 24, B, 15).</p>

<p>(3) <span class="smcap">The jaws.</span></p>

<p>The <b>upper jaw</b> consists of a rod of cartilage connected
with the cranium near its two ends, but widely separated from
it in the middle. It is almost completely overlain by membrane
bone. With its posterior end the lower jaw articulates.</p>

<p>The membrane bones of the upper jaw include first the
<i>premaxillae</i>, a small bone meeting its fellow in the middle
line, and forming the extreme anterior end of the upper jaw.
It gives off on its dorsal surface a backwardly-projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
process. It is connected behind with the <i>maxillae</i> (figs. 24 and
26, 10), a long flattened bone which forms the greater part of
the margin of the upper jaw, and gives off near its anterior end
a short process which projects upwards and meets the nasal.</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>Both maxillae and premaxillae are grooved ventrally, and
bear, attached to the outer more prominent margin of the groove,
a row of minute conical teeth. These teeth are <b>pleurodont</b>,
that is, are ankylosed by their bases and outer sides to the
margin of the jaw. Each tooth is a hollow cone, the basal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
part of which is formed of bone, the apical part of dentine,
capped by a very weak development of enamel.</p>

<p>The posterior end of the maxillae is overlapped by a small
bone, the <i>quadratojugal</i> (figs. 24 and 26, 9), whose posterior
end forms part of the articular surface for the lower jaw.
Just behind the quadratojugal there is a small unossified area
which lies at the angle of the mouth, and is connected by a
narrow bar of cartilage with the cranium; this forms the
<b>quadrate</b> (figs. 24 and 26, 19). A backwardly-directed outgrowth
from the cartilaginous bar more or less completely
surrounds the tympanic membrane, forming the tympanic
ring. When followed back the maxillae and quadratojugal
diverge further and further from the cranium, till the angle
of the mouth comes to be separated from the foramen magnum
by a space nearly double the width of the cranium. This space
is bridged over to a considerable extent by two triradiate bones,
the <i>pterygoid</i> and <i>squamosal</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>pterygoid</i> (figs. 24 and 26, 3) is a large bone, whose
anterior limb runs forwards meeting the maxillae and palatine;
while its inner limb meets the auditory capsule and parasphenoid,
and its outer limb runs backwards and outwards
to the angle of the mouth. The <i>palatine</i> is a small transversely-placed
bone, which connects the pterygoid with the anterior
part of the sphenethmoid. The <i>squamosal</i> (figs. 24 and 26, 4)
is a T-shaped bone whose anterior arm is pointed and passes
forwards to meet the pterygoid. The posterior upper arm is
closely applied to the pro-otic, while the posterior lower arm
meets the pterygoid and quadratojugal at the angle of the jaw,
and surrounds the narrow cartilaginous bar of the quadrate
which goes to join the cranium. The squamosal is probably
homologous with the squamosal together with the pre-opercular
of Bony Ganoids.</p>

<p>The quadrate and squamosal form the <b>suspensorium</b> by
which the lower jaw is connected with the cranium.</p>

<p>The <b>lower jaw</b> or <b>mandible</b> consists of a pair of cartilaginous
rods (<b>Meckel's cartilages</b>) in connection with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of which there are developed two membrane bones and one
cartilage bone. The cartilage bone is the <b>mento-meckelian</b>
(fig. 26, A, 14), a very small ossification at the extreme anterior
end. The membrane bones are the <i>angulo-splenial</i> and the
<i>dentary</i>. The <i>angulo-splenial</i> is a strong flat bone which forms
the inner and lower part of the mandible for the greater
part of its length. Its dorsal surface is produced into a slight
<b>coronoid process</b>. The <i>dentary</i> (fig. 26, A, 15) is a flat
plate which covers the outer surface of the anterior half of the
mandible, as far forwards as the mento-meckelian. The lower
jaw is devoid of teeth. The part of Meckel's cartilage which
in most vertebrates ossifies, forming the articular bone, remains
unossified in the Frog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Hyoid apparatus.</span></p>

<p>The <b>hyoid</b> of the adult Frog is formed of the modified
hyoid and branchial arches of the tadpole. It consists of a
broad thin plate of cartilage, the <b>basilingual plate</b> (fig. 29,
B, 1), drawn out into two pairs of long processes, the <b>cornua</b>.
The basilingual plate is broader in front than behind, and is
formed from the fused ventral ends of the hyoid and branchial
arches of the tadpole.</p>

<p>The <b>anterior cornua</b> (fig. 29, B, 2) form a pair of long
slender cartilaginous rods which project from the body of the
hyoid at first forwards, then backwards, and finally upwards
and somewhat forwards again, to be united to the auditory
capsules just below the fenestrae ovales. They are formed
from the dorsal portion of the hyoid arch of the tadpole and
are homologous with the cerato-hyals of the Dogfish.</p>

<p>The <b>posterior cornua</b> form a pair of straight bony rods
diverging outwards from the posterior end of the basilingual
plate. They are formed from the fourth branchial arches of
the tadpole, and differ from the rest of the hyoid apparatus
in being well ossified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>columellar chain</b>, which has been already described
(p. 157), should be mentioned with the hyoid as it is homologous
to the hyomandibular of fishes.</p>

<p>The <b>sternum</b> of the <b>Frog</b>, though regarded as part of the
axial skeleton, is so intimately connected with the pectoral
girdle, that it will be described with the appendicular
skeleton.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This consists of the skeleton of the two pairs of limbs and
their respective girdles. It is at first entirely cartilaginous
but the cartilage becomes later on mainly replaced by bone.
The only bone developed in connection with the appendicular
skeleton, which has no cartilaginous predecessor, is the
<i>clavicle</i>.</p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Pectoral girdle.</span></p>

<p>This consists originally of two half rings of cartilage encircling
the sides of the body a short way behind the head.
These two halves meet one another in the ventral middle line,
and separate the anterior elements of the sternum from the
posterior ones.</p>

<p>Each half-ring bears on the middle of its outer and posterior
surface a prominent cup, the <b>glenoid cavity</b>, with
which the proximal arm-bone articulates. This cup divides
the half-arch into a dorsal <b>scapular</b> and a ventral <b>coracoid</b>
portion.</p>

<p>The <b>scapular portion</b> consists of two parts, the <b>suprascapula</b>
and the <b>scapula</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>suprascapula</b> (fig. 30, A, 2) is a wide, thin plate
attached by its ventral and narrowest border to the scapula.
Its proximal and anterior half is imperfectly ossified, its whole
border or sometimes only its dorsal and posterior borders consist
of unaltered hyaline cartilage, while the rest of it is composed
of calcified cartilage. The <b>scapula</b> (fig. 30, A, 3) is a fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
stout rod of bone constricted in the middle, and forming the
dorsal half of the glenoid cavity.</p>

<p>The <b>coracoid portion</b> consists of three parts, the <b>coracoid</b>,
<b>precoracoid</b> and <i>clavicle</i>.</p>

<p>The largest and most posterior of these is the <i>coracoid</i>
(fig. 30, A, 4) which like the scapula, is contracted in the
middle and expanded at the ends, especially at the ventral
end. It forms a large part of the glenoid cavity. The
ventral ends of the coracoids which meet one another in the
middle line are unossified, and form narrow strips of calcified
cartilage, the <b>epicoracoids</b> (fig. 30, A, 5); these are often
regarded as sternal elements.</p>

<p>The <b>precoracoid</b> forms a narrow strip of cartilage lying
in front of the coracoid, from which it is separated by the
wide <b>coracoid foramen</b> (fig. 30, A, 9). The dorsal end is
continuous with an area of unossified cartilage which separates
the coracoid and scapula and forms part of the glenoid cavity.</p>

<p>The <i>clavicle</i> is a narrow membrane bone closely attached
to the anterior surface of the precoracoid, its dorsal end is expanded.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sternum.</span></p>

<p>The sternum consists of four parts arranged in two groups;
two parts to each group. The anterior members are the episternum
and omosternum.</p>

<p>The <b>episternum</b> (fig. 30, A, 10) is a thin almost circular
plate of cartilage much of which remains hyaline.</p>

<p>The <b>omosternum</b> (fig. 30, A, 11) is a slender bony rod
widest at its posterior end; it connects the episternum with
the ventral ends of the precoracoids.</p>

<p>The <b>sternum proper</b> is a short rod of cartilage sheathed
in bone; it is contracted in the middle and expanded at each
end. It bears attached to its posterior end a broad somewhat
bilobed plate of partially calcified cartilage, the <b>xiphisternum</b>
(fig. 30, A, 13).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Anterior limb.</span></p>

<p>This is divisible into three parts, the <b>upper arm</b> or
<b>brachium</b>, the <b>fore-arm</b> or <b>antibrachium</b>, and the <b>manus</b>.</p>

<p>All the larger bones have their ends formed by prominent
epiphyses which do not unite with the shaft till late in life.
Their articulating surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage.</p>

<p>In the <b>upper arm</b> there is a single bone, the <b>humerus</b>.</p>

<p>This has a more or less cylindrical shaft and articulates by
a prominent rounded <b>head</b> with the glenoid cavity. The
distal end shows a large rounded swelling on either side of
which is a <b>condylar ridge</b>, the inner or postaxial one being
the larger. A prominent <b>deltoid ridge</b> runs along the
proximal half of the anterior surface, and in the male frog a
second equally prominent ridge runs along the distal half of
the posterior surface.</p>

<p>The <b>fore-arm</b> consists of two bones, the <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b>,
united together and forming the <b>radio-ulna</b>. The two bones
are quite fused at their proximal ends where they form a
deep cup which articulates with the distal end of the humerus,
and is drawn out into a rather prominent backwardly-projecting
<b>olecranon process</b>, which ossifies from a centre
distinct from that of the shaft. The distal end is distinctly
divided by a groove into an anterior radial and a posterior
ulnar portion.</p>

<p>The <b>manus</b> consists of two parts, the <b>wrist</b> or <b>carpus</b>
and the <b>hand</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>carpus</b><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> consists of six small bones arranged in two
rows. The three bones of the proximal row are the <b>ulnare</b>,
<b>radiale</b> and <b>centrale</b>. The <b>ulnare</b> and <b>radiale</b> are about
equal in size and articulate regularly with the radio-ulna. The
<b>centrale</b> is pushed out of its normal position and lies partly on
the pre-axial side, partly in front of the radiale. Of the three
bones of the distal row the two pre-axial ones, <b>carpalia 1</b> and
<b>2</b>, are small; carpale 2 articulates with the second metacarpal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
carpale 1 with both the first and second. The third bone is
large and articulates with the third, fourth and fifth metacarpals,
it represents <b>carpalia 3-5</b>, with probably in addition
the representative of a second centrale.</p>

<p>The <b>hand</b> consists of four complete digits, and a vestigial
<b>pollex</b> reduced to a short metacarpal.</p>

<p>Each of the four complete digits consists of a <b>metacarpal</b>
and a variable number of <b>phalanges</b>. The first digit, as just
mentioned, has no phalanges, the second and third have two,
and the fourth and fifth have three.</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Pelvic girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic girdle of the Frog is much modified from the
simple or general type found in the Newt (p. 149).</p>

<p>It is a V-shaped structure consisting of two halves which
are fused together in the middle line posteriorly, while in
front they are attached to the ends of the transverse processes
of the sacral vertebra. Each half bears at its posterior
end a deep cup, the <b>acetabulum</b>, with which the head of the
femur articulates.</p>

<p>Each half of the pelvis ossifies from two centres. The
anterior and upper half of the acetabulum, and the long
laterally compressed bar extending forwards to meet the sacral
vertebra ossify from a single centre and are generally called
the <b>ilium</b>; it is probable however that they represent both
the <b>ilium</b> and <b>pubis</b> of mammals<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. The posterior part of
this bone meets its fellow in a median symphysis.</p>

<p>The posterior third of the acetabulum is formed by a small
bone, the <b>ischium</b>, which likewise meets its fellow in a
median symphysis.</p>

<p>The ventral portion of the pelvic girdle never ossifies, even
in old animals being formed only of calcified cartilage. This
is generally regarded as the pubis, but it perhaps corresponds
to the <b>acetabular bone</b> of mammals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>


<p>D. <span class="smcap">The Posterior limb.</span></p>

<p>This corresponds closely to the anterior limb and, like it,
is divisible into three parts, the <b>thigh</b>, the <b>shin</b> or <b>crus</b> and
the <b>pes</b>.</p>

<p>As was the case with the anterior limb, all the long bones
have their ends formed by prominent epiphyses which do not
unite with the shaft till late in life.</p>

<p>In the <b>thigh</b> there is only a single bone, the <b>femur</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>femur</b> is a moderately long, slender bone with a well-ossified
hollow shaft slightly curved in a sigmoid manner.
Both ends are expanded, the proximal end is hemispherical
and articulates with the acetabulum, the distal end is larger
and more laterally expanded.</p>

<p>The <b>shin</b> likewise includes a single bone, the <b>tibio-fibula</b>,
but this, as can be readily seen by the grooves at the proximal
and distal ends of the shaft, is formed by the fusion of two
distinct bones, the <b>tibia</b> and <b>fibula</b>. The tibio-fibula is longer
and straighter than the femur.</p>

<p>The <b>pes</b> consists of two parts, the <b>ankle</b> or <b>tarsus</b> and the
<b>foot</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>tarsus</b> consists of two rows of structures, very different
in size. The proximal row consists of two long bones,
the <b>tibiale</b> and <b>fibulare</b>, which are united by common epiphyses
at the two ends, while in the middle they are widely
separated. The tibiale lies on the tibial or pre-axial side,
and the fibulare which is the larger of the two bones on
the fibular or postaxial side. The distal row of tarsals
consists of three very small pieces of calcified cartilage. The
postaxial of these is the largest, it articulates with the second
and third metatarsals and is probably homologous with tarsalia
2 and 3 fused. The middle one is very small, it articulates
with the first metatarsal and is probably tarsale 1. The pre-axial
one articulates with the metatarsal of the calcar, a
structure to be described immediately, and has been regarded
as a <b>centrale</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>foot</b> includes five complete digits and a supplemental
toe as well. Each of the five digits consists of a long <b>metatarsal</b>
with epiphyses at both ends, and of a variable number
of phalanges. The first digit or <b>hallux</b> and the second have
two phalanges, the third three, the fourth, which is the largest,
four, and the fifth, three. The distal phalanges have epiphyses
only at their proximal ends, the others at both ends.</p>

<p>On the pre-axial side of the hallux is the supplemental
digit, the <b>prehallux</b> or <b>calcar</b>. It consists of a short metatarsal
and one or two phalanges, and is terminated distally by
a horny covering of epidermal origin.</p>

<small>GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN AMPHIBIA.</small></h2>


<p>EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton, at any rate in most living forms, is very
slightly developed in Amphibia. The only representatives
of the epidermal exoskeleton are (1) the minute horny beaks
found coating the premaxillae and dentaries in <i>Siren</i> and the
tadpoles of most Anura, (2) the nails borne by the first three
digits of the pes in <i>Xenopus</i> and by the Japanese Salamander
<i>Onychodactylus</i>, (3) the horny covering of the calcar or prehallux
of frogs. The Urodela and nearly all the Anura, which
form the vast majority of living Amphibia, have naked skins.
A few Anura belonging to the genera <i>Ceratophrys</i> and <i>Brachycephalus</i>
have bony dermal plates developed in the skin of the
back, and these plates become united with some of the underlying
vertebrae.</p>

<p>In the Gymnophiona the integument bears small cycloid
scales arranged in rings which are equal in number to the
vertebrae. These scales contain calcareous concretions. Scales
also occur between the successive rings.</p>

<p>In the Labyrinthodontia the dermal exoskeleton is in
many genera greatly developed. It is generally limited to the
ventral surface and consists principally of a buckler formed
of three bony plates, one median and two lateral. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
plates protect the anterior part of the thorax, and are closely
connected with the adjacent endoskeleton. They probably
represent the interclavicle and clavicles. Behind this buckler
numerous scutes are generally developed, which often cover
the whole ventral surface, and may cover the whole body.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Teeth<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</span></p>

<p>In Amphibia teeth are generally present on the maxillae,
premaxillae and vomers, and except in Anura on the dentaries;
sometimes they occur on the palatines as in many Urodela, most
Labyrinthodontia, and the Gymnophiona; less commonly on the
pterygoids as in <i>Menobranchus</i>, <i>Siredon</i>, some Labyrinthodontia,
and <i>Pelobates cultripes</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, or on the splenials as in <i>Siren</i> and <i>Menobranchus</i>,
or parasphenoid as in <i>Pelobates cultripes</i>, <i>Spelerpes
belli</i> and <i>Batrachoseps</i>. In some Anura such as <i>Bufo</i> and <i>Pipa</i>
the jaws are toothless.</p>

<p>In Gymnophiona, <i>Menobranchus</i>, and <i>Siredon</i>, the teeth
are arranged in two concentric curved rows. The teeth of the
outer row are borne on the premaxillae and maxillae if present,
(the maxillae are absent in <i>Menobranchus</i>), the teeth of the
second row on the vomers and pterygoids in <i>Menobranchus</i>
and <i>Siredon</i>, and on the vomers and palatines in Gymnophiona.
In some Gymnophiona there is a double row of mandibular
teeth. The vomerine, palatine and parasphenoid teeth of all
forms are numerous and are not arranged in rows.</p>

<p>The teeth of all living Amphibia are simple conical structures
ankylosed to the bone, and consisting of dentine, coated
or capped with a thin layer of enamel. In the Labyrinthodontia
teeth of more than one size are sometimes present. The dentine
of the basal part of the larger teeth is in some genera very
greatly folded, causing the structure to be highly complicated.
These folds, the intervals between which are filled with cement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
radiate inwards from the exterior and outwards from the large
pulp cavity. The basal part of the teeth of <i>Ceratophrys</i>
(Anura) has a similar structure.</p>


<p>ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vertebral column.</span></p>

<p>Four regions of the vertebral column can generally be
recognised in Amphibia, viz. the cervical, the trunk or thoraco-lumbar,
the sacral and the caudal regions. In the limbless
Gymnophiona, however, only three regions, the cervical, thoracic,
and post-thoracic can be made out. The cervical region
is limited to a single vertebra which generally differs from the
others in having no transverse processes or indication of ribs.
It is generally called the atlas, but it commonly bears a small
process arising from the anterior face of the centrum which
resembles the odontoid process of higher animals, and renders
it probable that the first vertebra of Amphibia corresponds
to the axis, not to the atlas. Amphibia generally have a
single sacral vertebra.</p>

<p>Three elements go to make up the vertebral column in
Amphibia, viz.</p>

<p>1. the notochord,</p>

<p>2. the long vertebral centra,</p>

<p>3. intervertebral cartilage which forms the joints between
successive centra.</p>

<p>The relations which these three elements bear to one
another are subject to much variation. The successive stages
can be well traced in the Urodela.</p>

<p>1. The first stage is found in larval Urodeles in general
and in adult Ichthyoidea, and some Salamandrina. In these
forms the notochord persists and retains approximately the
same diameter throughout the whole length of the vertebral
column. Bony biconcave centra are present and constrict it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to a certain extent vertebrally, while intervertebrally there is
a development of cartilage. The connection between the bony
vertebrae is effected mainly by the expanded notochord.</p>

<p>2. In the next stage, as seen in <i>Gyrinophilus porphyriticus</i>,
the growth of intervertebral cartilage has caused the
almost complete obliteration of the notochord intervertebrally,
and its entire disappearance vertebrally, i.e. in the centre of
each vertebra. The intervertebral cartilage now forms the main
connection between successive vertebrae, and sometimes cases
are found whose condition approaches that of definite articulations.
Readily recognisable remains of the notochord are still
found at each end of the intervertebral constriction.</p>

<p>3. In the third stage differentiation and absorption of the
intervertebral cartilage has given rise to definitely articulating
opisthocoelous vertebrae. These are found in most adult
Salamandrina.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The transverse processes of the earlier trunk vertebrae
are divided into two parts, a dorsal part which meets the
tubercular process of the rib and is derived from the neural
arch, and a ventral part which meets the capitular process of
the rib, and is derived from the ventral or haemal arch. In
the caudal vertebrae and often also in the posterior trunk
vertebrae the two processes are fused.</p>

<p><i>Siren</i> and <i>Proteus</i>, although they possess minute posterior
limbs, have no sacral vertebrae, while <i>Cryptobranchus lateralis</i>
has two. The caudal vertebrae, except the first, have haemal
arches very similar to the neural arches.</p>

<p>In Labyrinthodontia the centra of the vertebrae are generally
well ossified biconcave discs. In some forms however, like
<i>Euchirosaurus</i>, the centra are imperfectly ossified, and consist
of bony rings traversed by a wide notochordal canal. Each
ring is formed of four pieces, a large well-ossified neural arch,
a basal piece, and a pair of lateral pieces. Vertebrae of this
type are called <i>rachitomous</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>In the tail region of other forms each vertebra consists
of an anterior centrum bearing the neural arch, and a posterior
intercentrum<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> bearing chevron bones. Vertebrae of this
type are called <i>embolomerous</i>. Haemal arches similar to the
neural arches are often found as in Urodela. The transverse
processes are sometimes well developed and are divided into
tubercular and capitular portions.</p>

<p>In Gymnophiona the vertebrae are biconcave and are very
numerous, they sometimes number about two hundred and
thirty. Only quite the last few are ribless and so can be
regarded as post-thoracic vertebrae. The first vertebra has
nothing of the nature of an odontoid process.</p>

<p>In Anura the number of vertebrae is very greatly reduced,
only nine and the urostyle being present. Of these, eight are
presacral and one sacral. The urostyle is post-sacral and
corresponds to three or more modified vertebrae. The first
vertebra is without transverse processes, the remaining presacral
vertebrae have the transverse processes fairly large,
while the sacral vertebra has them very large, forming in
some genera widely expanded plates. The urostyle is a long
cylindrical rod which articulates with the sacrum generally by
two facets. Ankylosed to its anterior end are the remains
of two neural arches.</p>

<p>In Anura remains of the notochord are found in the centre
of each vertebra, i.e. vertebrally, while in the Urodela they
only occur intervertebrally.</p>

<p>The vertebrae in Anura are, as a rule, procoelous. The
eighth vertebra is however generally amphicoelous, while
the ninth commonly has one convexity in front, and two
behind.</p>

<p>In some forms such as <i>Bombinator</i>, <i>Pipa</i>, <i>Discoglossus</i> and
<i>Alytes</i> they are opisthocoelous; in others like <i>Pelobates</i> they
are variable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Skull<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cranium and mandible.</span></p>

<p>In the Amphibian skull there are as a rule far fewer bones
than in the skull of bony fish. The primordial cartilaginous
cranium often persists to a great extent. Only quite a few
ossifications take place in it; namely in the occipital region&mdash;the
exoccipitals, further forwards&mdash;the pro-otics, and at the
boundary of the orbital and ethmoidal regions&mdash;the sphenethmoid.
The basi-occipital and basisphenoid are never
ossified. As in Mammalia there are two occipital condyles
formed by the exoccipitals.</p>

<p>Large vacuities commonly occur in the cartilage of both
floor and roof of the primordial cranium. These are roofed
over to a greater or less extent by the development of membrane
bone. Thus on the roof of the cranium there are paired
parietals, frontals, and nasals, and on its floor are paired
vomers, and a median unpaired parasphenoid.</p>

<p>In all living forms the parietals meet and there is no
interparietal foramen, though this exists in Labyrinthodonts.</p>

<p>The palato-pterygo-quadrate bar is united at each end with
the cranium, but elsewhere in most cases forms a wide arch
standing away from it. The suspensorium is, as in Dipnoi
and Holocephali, autostylic. The palato-pterygo-quadrate bar
sometimes remains entirely cartilaginous, sometimes its posterior
half is ossified forming the quadrate. In connection
with it a number of membrane bones are generally developed,
viz. the maxillae, premaxillae, palatines, pterygoids, quadratojugals,
and squamosals. The pterygoids are, however, sometimes
partially formed by the ossification of cartilage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
cartilage of the lower jaw and its investing membrane bones
generally have much the same relations as in bony fishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Urodela.</span> The skulls of the various Urodeles show an
interesting series of modifications and differ much from one
another, but all agree in the absence of the quadratojugals,
in the fact that the palatines lie parallel to the axis of the
cranium, and in the large size of the parasphenoid.</p>

<p>The lower types <i>Menobranchus</i>, <i>Siren</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Amphiuma</i>
have longer and narrower skulls than do the higher
types.</p>

<p><i>Menobranchus</i> has a very low type of skull which remains
throughout life in much the same condition as that of a young
tadpole or larval salamander. The roof and floor of the
cranium internal to the membrane bones are formed of fibrous
tissue, not of well-developed cartilage. The epi-otic regions of
the skull are ossified, forming a pair of large bones which lie
external to, and distinct from, the exoccipitals. <i>Proteus</i> and
the Labyrinthodonts are the only other Amphibia which have
these elements separately ossified. The parietals send a pair
of long processes forwards along the sides of the frontals.
Nasals and maxillae are absent, as is likewise the case in
<i>Proteus</i>. Teeth are borne on the vomers, premaxillae, pterygoids,
dentaries and angulo-splenials. The suspensorium is
forwardly directed.</p>

<p>The skull of <i>Siren</i> resembles that of <i>Menobranchus</i> in
several respects, as in the forward direction of the suspensorium
and in the absence of maxillae, but differs in the
possession of nasals, in the toothless condition of the premaxillae
and dentaries, and in the fusion and dentigerous condition
of the vomers and palatines.</p>

<p><i>Amphiuma</i> has a skull which, though narrow and elongated,
differs from those of <i>Menobranchus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Siren</i>, and
resembles those of higher types in the following respects:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the suspensorium projects nearly at right angles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the cranium instead of being directed forwards, (2) the
maxillae are well developed, and the premaxillae are completely
ankylosed together, (3) there are no palatines.</p>

<p>The skulls of <i>Megalobatrachus</i>, <i>Cryptobranchus</i> and <i>Siredon</i>
resemble those of the highest Urodeles the Salamanders in their
wide form, in having the pro-otics distinct from the exoccipitals
which are ossified continuously with the epi-otics and opisthotics,
and in having no palatines, but differ in having the two
premaxillae separate, and in the arrangement of the vomerine
teeth which in <i>Megalobatrachus</i> and <i>Cryptobranchus</i> are placed
along the anterior boundaries of the bones, these meeting in
the middle line. In <i>Siredon</i> the vomers are separated by the
very large parasphenoid.</p>

<p>The suspensorium in <i>Megalobatrachus</i> and <i>Cryptobranchus</i>
projects at right angles to the cranium; in <i>Siredon</i> it projects
somewhat downwards and forwards as in the Salamandrina.</p>

<p>Modifications of the vomers, pterygoids and palatines accompany
the changes of the larval ichthyoid <i>Siredon</i> into the
adult salamandroid <i>Amblystoma</i>, the vomers especially come
to resemble to a much greater extent those of the Salamandrina.</p>

<p>The ossification of the skull in the Salamandrina is carried
further than in the Ichthyoidea, though the supra-occipital and
basi-occipital are not ossified. The skull differs from that in
the Ichthyoidea in the size of the part of the vomero-palatines
which lies in front of the teeth, in the frequent union of the
two premaxillae and in the ossification of all the periotic bones
continuously with the exoccipital.</p>

<p>The skull differs from that of Anura in the following
respects:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the bones of the upper jaw do not form a complete
arch standing away from the cranium, and the maxillae are
not united to the quadrates by quadratojugals, (2) the long
axis of the suspensorium passes obliquely downwards and
forwards instead of downwards and backwards, (3) there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sphenethmoid encircling the anterior end of the brain, its place
being partly taken by a pair of orbitosphenoids, (4) there is no
definite tympanic cavity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Labyrinthodontia.</span> The skull in Labyrinthodontia is remarkable
for its extreme solidity, the large number of bones
which are present, and the extent to which the roofing over of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the temporal and other fossae has taken place. In many
forms the surface of the bones is as in Crocodiles, strongly
sculptured (fig. 27, right half) with ridges and grooves which
probably lodged sensory organs. The bones forming the
roof of the skull are generally very uniform in size, perhaps
the most noticeable of them being the paired dermo-supra-occipitals
(fig. 27, 19). Paired dermo-supra-occipitals occur
also in certain Ganoids. The Labyrinthodont skull also
bears resemblance to that of many fish in the development
of a pair of long pointed epi-otics (fig. 27, 18), which remain
permanently distinct from the surrounding bones. The parietals
are small and enclose between them the interparietal
foramen (fig. 27, 13). In some forms in which the head is
protected with an armour of scutes, these do not roof over
the interparietal foramen, and from this fact it has been
inferred that the Labyrinthodonts had a functional pineal
eye. Both supra- and infra-temporal fossae are partially or
completely roofed over by the postorbitals and large supra-temporals
(fig. 27, 15).</p>

<p>There is generally a ring of bones in the sclerotic coat
of the eye. The pterygoids do not meet in the middle line,
being separated by the parasphenoid. The palatines bear
teeth, and in some genera (<i>Archegosaurus</i>) form long splints
lying along the inner side of the maxillae and more or less
surrounding the posterior nares. In others (<i>Nyrania</i>) they
lie in the normal position near the middle line, one on
each side of the parasphenoid. The vomers bear teeth and
sometimes meet in the middle line; they are sometimes
confluent with the parasphenoid. On the ventral surface
of the cranium there are generally large palatal vacuities.</p>

<p>In the mandible there is often a well-marked postglenoid
process, and the articular is generally completely ossified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gymnophiona.</span> The skull bears a considerable resemblance
to that of Labyrinthodonts, especially in the arrangement of
the bones which bound the mouth cavity. The cranium is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
very hard, and is covered by a complete bony roof formed
mainly of the exoccipitals, parietals, frontals, prefrontals,
nasals and premaxillae. The nasals and premaxillae are
sometimes ossified continuously. There is a median unpaired
ethmoid whose dorsal end appears at the surface wedged in
between the frontals and parietals. The bone generally
regarded as the squamosal<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> is very large, and it and the
maxillae generally together surround the orbit, which, in
<i>Epicrium</i>, has in it a ring of bones. The palatines form long
tooth-bearing bones fused with the inner sides of the maxillae;
they nearly surround the posterior nares.</p>

<p>The quadrate bears the knob, and the angular the cup
for the articulation of the mandible,&mdash;a very primitive feature.
The mandible is also noticeable for the enormous backward
projection of the angular.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Anura.</span> In Anura the skull is very short and wide
owing to the transverse position of the suspensorium. There
is often a small ossification representing the quadrate. Sometimes
as in <i>Hyla</i> and <i>Alytes</i> there is a fronto-parietal
fontanelle.</p>

<p>As compared with the skull in Urodela the chief characteristics
of the skull of Anura are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. the presence of a sphenethmoid,</p>

<p>2. the union of the frontals and parietals on each side,</p>

<p>3. the occasional occurrence of small supra- and basi-occipitals,</p>

<p>4. the backward growth of the maxillae and its connection
with the suspensorium by means of the quadratojugal,</p>

<p>5. the dagger-like shape of the parasphenoid,</p>

<p>6. the occurrence of a definite tympanic cavity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>7. the frequent occurrence of a predentary or mento-meckelian
ossification in the mandible.</p>

<p>The skull of <i>Pipa</i> is abnormal, being greatly flattened and
containing little cartilage. The fronto-parietals are fused, and
there is no sphenethmoid. The quadrates are well developed
and the squamosals and parasphenoid differ much from those
of other Anura.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hyoid and branchial arches.</span></p>

<p>In larval Amphibia the hyoid and four branchial arches
are generally present, and in adult Ichthyoidea they are
frequently almost as well represented as in the larva, and
are of use in strengthening the swallowing apparatus. They
are very well seen in <i>Siredon</i>, and consist of a hyoid attached
by ligaments to the suspensorium, followed by four branchial
arches of which the first and second are united by a copula
(fig. 29, D, 8), while the third and fourth are not. The hyoid
is not always the largest and best preserved of the arches,
for sometimes as in <i>Spelerpes</i> one of the branchials is far
larger than the hyoid. Four branchial arches occur in <i>Siren</i>
as in <i>Siredon</i>, but in <i>Proteus</i> there are only three.</p>

<p>In some larval Labyrinthodontia (<i>Branchiosaurus</i>) four
branchial arches are known to occur, and their arrangement
is almost precisely similar to that in <i>Siredon</i>.</p>

<p>In Gymnophiona the remains of only three branchial
arches occur in addition to the hyoid. The four arches are
all very similar to one another, each consists of a curved rod
of uniform diameter throughout. The hyoid is united with
the first branchial arch, but has no attachment to the
cranium.</p>

<p>In larval Anura (fig. 29, C) the arrangement of the
hyoid and branchial arches is much as in Urodela. In the
adult, however, the ventral parts of all the arches unite, forming
a compact structure, the <i>basilingual plate</i> (fig. 29, B, 1).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The dorsal parts of the first three branchial arches disappear,
but those of the fourth become ossified and form the short,
stout thyro-hyals or posterior cornua. The dorsal parts of the
hyoid arch in the adult form a pair of long bars, the anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
cornua, which are united to the periotic region of the skull in
front of the fenestra ovalis either by short ligaments or by
fusion as in <i>Bufo</i>. In <i>Pipa</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> the first and
second branchial arches persist as well as the fourth (thyro-hyal),
but in <i>Pipa</i> the hyoid is wanting.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ribs.</span></p>

<p>Ribs are generally very poorly developed in Amphibia.
In Anura they are in most cases absent; when present they
generally form minute unossified appendages attached to the
transverse processes, but in <i>Discoglossus</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> the
anterior vertebrae are provided with distinct ribs. In
Urodela and Labyrinthodontia they are generally short
structures, each as a rule attached to the vertebra by a
bifurcated proximal end. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae
varies, but the first and the posterior caudal vertebrae are
always ribless. The anterior caudal vertebrae too are generally
ribless, but sometimes a few of them bear small ribs.
In <i>Spelerpes</i> the last two trunk vertebrae are ribless, and
hence may be regarded as lumbar vertebrae.</p>

<p>In Gymnophiona ribs are better developed than in any
other Amphibia; they occur on all the vertebrae except the
first and last few, and are attached to the transverse processes,
sometimes by single, sometimes by double heads.</p>

<p>Sternal ribs are almost unknown in Amphibia, but traces
of them occur in <i>Menobranchus.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sternum.</span></p>

<p>In Amphibia the sternum is not very well developed;
sometimes as in Gymnophiona and <i>Proteus</i> no traces of it
occur, and in the Urodela it is never ossified. It is always
very intimately related to the pectoral girdle. In the Salamandrina
it has the form of a broad thin plate of cartilage,
grooved and overlapped by the coracoid.</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>In most Anura the sternum consists of a number of parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
arranged in series. At the anterior end is a flat cartilaginous
plate with a bony basal stalk. This plate is called the episternum,
and its stalk the omosternum. The continuity of
the sternum is now interrupted by a pair of cartilaginous
structures, the epicoracoids, which are shoulder-girdle elements,
and represent the unossified ventral ends of the coracoids. In
some cases cartilaginous epiprecoracoids can also be distinguished.
Further back is the long sternum proper, while last
comes the xiphisternum, a broad expanded plate of cartilage.</p>

<p>In some Anura such as <i>Pipa</i> and <i>Hyla</i> the number of
sternal elements is considerably reduced.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pectoral girdle.</span></p>

<p>The most primitive Amphibian shoulder-girdle is found in
the Urodela. It consists of a dorsal element, the scapula,
a posterior ventral element, the coracoid, and an anterior
ventral element, the precoracoid. The clavicle is not developed,
and the two coracoids overlap in the middle line.
The shoulder-girdle remains largely cartilaginous but the
proximal end of the scapula is ossified, and the ossification
may extend through part of the coracoid and precoracoid.</p>

<p>In Labyrinthodontia there is an exoskeletal ventral buckler
formed of three plates, a median one, which probably represents
an interclavicle, and two lateral ones, which are probably
clavicles. Traces of endoskeletal structures, probably corresponding
to the precoracoid and scapula, are also known in
some cases. The Gymnophiona and some of the Labyrinthodontia
have lost the pectoral girdle and limbs.</p>

<p>The ossification of the shoulder-girdle has gone on much
further in Anura than it has in Urodela. Clavicles are present
and the scapula and coracoid of each side are ossified from
separate centres. The distal part of the scapula forms a large
imperfectly ossified plate, the suprascapula.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The shoulder-girdle of Anura is however subject to considerable
variations. In the Toads (Bufonidae) the epicoracoids
or unossified ventral ends of the coracoids and precoracoids
overlap in the middle line (fig. 30, B, 5). This
arrangement is called <i>Arciferous</i>. In the Frogs,&mdash;Ranidae,
and other forms belonging to the group <i>Firmisternia</i>,&mdash;the
epicoracoids do not overlap but form a narrow cartilaginous
bar separating the ventral ends of the coracoids (fig. 30, A, 5).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Anterior limb.</span></p>

<p>In many Amphibia and especially in the Urodela the
anterior limb has a very simple unmodified arrangement.
The humerus is straight and of moderate length, its ends are
rounded for articulation on the one hand with the shoulder-girdle,
and on the other hand with the radius and ulna. In
the Urodela the radius and ulna are distinct. In the Anura
they have fused, though the line of junction of the two
is not obliterated. Their proximal ends are hollowed for
articulation with the convex end of the humerus.</p>

<p>The manus in all recent Amphibia agrees in never having
more than four complete digits, but is subject to considerable
variation, this statement applying especially to the carpus.</p>

<p>In the larva of Salamandra (fig. 31, A), except that the
pollex is absent<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, the manus retains completely the condition
which is generally regarded as primitive for the higher
Vertebrata. It consists of an anterior row of three elements,
the ulnare, intermedium, and radiale, and a posterior row
of four, the carpalia 2, 3, 4, and 5. Interposed between the
two rows is a centrale. <i>Menobranchus</i> has a similar very
simple carpus. In most other Amphibia this simplicity is
lost. This loss may be due to:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) fusion of certain structures, e.g. in the adult <i>Salamandra</i>
the intermedium and ulnare have fused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) displacement of structures, e.g. in <i>Bufo viridis</i>, the
centrale has been pushed up till it comes to articulate with
the radius,</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) the development of supernumerary elements, especially
of extra centralia. In <i>Megalobatrachus</i> two or even three
centralia sometimes occur.</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>In the great majority of Amphibia while one digit,
probably the first, is absent, the other four digits are well
developed. In the forms however with degenerate limbs like
<i>Amphiuma</i>, <i>Siren</i> and <i>Proteus</i> the number of digits is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
further reduced. In <i>Siren</i> there are three or four, in <i>Proteus</i>
three, and in <i>Amphiuma</i> two or three digits in the manus.</p>

<p>In Anura the pollex is represented only by a short
metacarpal. There are sometimes traces of a prepollex.
The carpus often has two centralia and the intermedium
is absent.</p>

<p>In Labyrinthodontia the limbs are generally very simple
and resemble those of Urodela. In some forms, however, the
manus differs from that of all living Amphibia in possessing
five well-developed digits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pelvic girdle.</span></p>

<p>The simplest Amphibian pelvis is that of some of the
Labyrinthodontia; thus in <i>Mastodonsaurus</i> it consists dorsally
of a short broad ilium placed vertically and attached to the
sacrum, and ventrally of a small pubis and of a large
ischium meeting its fellow in the middle line. In some
Labyrinthodonts the pubes as well as the ischia meet in
a ventral symphysis, and in many there are no obturator
foramina. In <i>Siren</i>, Gymnophiona and some Labyrinthodontia
the pelvic girdle and limbs are absent.</p>

<p>In Urodela the ventral element of the pelvis on each side
forms a flat plate which meets its fellow of the opposite side.
The anterior part of the plate, representing the pubis, generally
remains cartilaginous throughout life; the posterior
part representing the ischium is in almost every case well
ossified. Attached to the anterior end of the pubes there is
an unpaired bifid cartilaginous structure, the epipubis. The
ilia are vertically placed.</p>

<p>In most Anura the pelvis is peculiarly modified in correlation
with the habits of jumping. The long bone generally
called the ilium is placed horizontally and is attached at its
extreme anterior end to the sacrum. The ischium is ossified
and distinct. Ventrally in front of the ischium there is a
tract of unossified cartilage which is often regarded as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
pubis. In <i>Xenopus</i>, however, the bone corresponding to the
ilium of the Frog is seen to ossify from two centres, one
forming the ilium, the other, which lies at the symphysis,
being apparently the pubis. This makes it probable that the
so-called ilium of the Frog is really to be regarded as an ilio-pubis,
and renders the homology of the cartilaginous part
uncertain, but it probably corresponds to the acetabular bone
of mammals. In <i>Xenopus</i> also there is a minute epipubis
similar to that of Urodeles.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Posterior limb.</span></p>

<p>In Urodela the posterior limb (fig. 31, B) closely resembles
the anterior limb, but is even less removed from the primitive
condition of the higher vertebrates in the fact that all five digits
are commonly present. The tibia and fibula are short bones
approximately equal in size. In some cases the number of
digits is reduced. Thus in <i>Menobranchus</i> the pes has four
digits, in <i>Proteus</i> it has two, and in <i>Amphiuma</i> two or three,
while in <i>Siren</i> the posterior limbs have atrophied.</p>

<p>In correlation with their habits of jumping, the posterior
limbs in Anura are much lengthened and considerably modified.
The tibia and fibula are completely fused. The intermedium
is absent, while the tibiale and fibulare are greatly elongated.
Tarsalia 4 and 5 are absent. Five digits are always present,
and there is a prehallux formed of two or more segments.</p>

<p>In general the posterior limbs in Labyrinthodontia bear the
closest resemblance to the anterior limbs; in some cases three
centralia are found.</p>

<p>In Ichthyoidea, and in most Labyrinthodontia, the cartilages
of the carpus and tarsus remain unossified; in Salamandrina
and in Anura they are generally ossified.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>SAUROPSIDA.</small></h2>


<p>This great group includes the Reptiles and Birds and
forms the second of the three into which the Gnathostomata
may be divided. There is nearly always a strongly-developed
epiblastic exoskeleton which has the form of scales or feathers,
and in some cases a dermal exoskeleton is also well developed.
In living forms the notochord never persists, being replaced
by vertebrae, but in some extinct forms the centra are
notochordal. The vertebral centra are ossified, and only in
exceptionally rare cases have terminal epiphyses. The skull
is well ossified and has membrane bones incorporated in its
walls.</p>

<p>The occipital segment is completely ossified, and an interorbital
septum or bony partition separating the two orbits
is usually developed to a greater or less extent. The skull
generally articulates with the vertebral column by a single
occipital condyle into the composition of which the exoccipitals
and basi-occipital enter in varying proportions.
The pro-otic ossifies, and either remains distinct from the
epi-otic<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and opisthotic throughout life, or unites with them
only after they have fused with the adjacent bones. The
hyoid and branchial arches are much reduced; and the
representative of the hyomandibular is connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
auditory apparatus, forming the auditory ossicles<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Each
ramus of the mandible always consists of a cartilage bone,
the articular, and several membrane bones. The mandible
articulates with the cranium by means of a quadrate. The
ribs in Birds and some Reptiles bear <i>uncinate processes</i>, i.e.
small, flat, bony or cartilaginous plates projecting backwards
from their posterior borders. The sternum is not transversely
segmented as in mammals, and there are commonly distinct
cervical ribs. The ankle joint is intertarsal, or situated
between the proximal and distal row of tarsal bones, not
cruro-tarsal as in Mammalia.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Class I. Reptilia</span><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>The axial skeleton is generally long, and that of the limbs
frequently comparatively short, or sometimes absent.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton generally has the form of epidermal
scales, which are often combined with underlying bony dermal
plates or scutes and may sometimes form a continuous armour.
Neither feathers nor true hairs are ever present. The vertebral
column is generally divisible into the five usual regions.
The centra of the vertebrae vary enormously, and may be
amphicoelous, procoelous, opisthocoelous or flat, but they never
have saddle-shaped articulating surfaces. The quadrate is
always large, and is sometimes fixed, sometimes movable.
A transpalatine bone uniting the pterygoid and maxillae is
generally present.</p>

<p>Free ribs are often borne along almost the whole length
of the trunk and tail, and often occur attached to the cervical
vertebrae. The sacrum is generally composed of two vertebrae
which are united with the ilia by means of expanded ribs.
The sternum is rhomboidal, and may either be cartilaginous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
or formed of cartilage bone, but never of membrane bone;
it differs from that of birds also in the fact that it does not
ossify from two or more centres. An interclavicle is generally
present. There are always more than three digits in the
manus, and never less than three in the pes. In all living
reptiles the ilia are prolonged further behind the acetabula
than in front of them, and the bones of the pelvis remain as
a rule, distinct from one another throughout life.</p>

<p>The pubes (pre-pubes) and ischia both commonly meet in
ventral symphysis, and the acetabula are wholly or almost
wholly ossified. The metatarsals are not ankylosed together.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 1.</i> <span class="smcap">Theromorpha</span><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>This order includes a number of mainly terrestrial, extinct
reptiles, which differ much from one another, and show remarkable
points of affinity on the one hand with the Labyrinthodont
Amphibia, and on the other with the Mammalia. The
vertebrae are nearly always amphicoelous and sometimes have
notochordal centra. The skull is short and has the quadrate
immovably fixed. There is an interparietal foramen, and generally
large supratemporal fossae bounded by supratemporal
arcades, but with no infratemporal<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> arcades; <i>Elginia</i> however
has the whole of the temporal region completely roofed over.</p>

<p>The teeth are placed in distinct sockets and are very
variable in form, the dentition sometimes resembling the
heterodont dentition of mammals. The humerus has distinct
condyles and an ent-epicondylar foramen<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> as in many mammals.</p>

<p>The pubis is fused with the ischium, and both pectoral and
pelvic girdles are remarkably solid. The obturator foramen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
is remarkably small or even absent. The anterior ribs have
two articulating surfaces, and each articulates by its tuberculum
with the transverse process, and by its capitulum with
the centrum as in mammals.</p>

<p>These reptiles occur chiefly in deposits of Triassic and
Permian age. Some of the best known genera are <i>Dicynodon</i>,
<i>Udenodon</i>, <i>Placodus</i>, <i>Pariasaurus</i> and <i>Galesaurus</i>. They will
be noticed in the general account of the skeleton in reptiles.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 2.</i> <span class="smcap">Sauropterygia.</span></p>

<p>This order includes a number of extinct marine reptiles,
devoid of an exoskeleton. The tail is short, the trunk long,
and the neck in the most typical forms extremely long. The
vertebrae have slightly biconcave, or nearly flat centra. The
skull is relatively small and has large supratemporal fossae.
The teeth are placed in distinct sockets, and are generally
confined to the margins of the jaws; they are sharp and
curved and are coated with grooved enamel. The premaxillae
are large, and there is an interparietal foramen. The quadrate
is firmly united to the cranium. The anterior nares are
separate and are placed somewhat close to the orbits. There
is no ossified sclerotic ring. The palatines and pterygoids
meet the vomers, and more or less completely close the palate,
and in some forms, e.g. <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, there is a distinct parasphenoid.
Thoracic ribs are strongly developed and each
articulates with its vertebra by a single head. The cervical
vertebrae have well-marked ribs, which articulate only with
the centra, in this respect differing from those of Crocodiles.
The caudal vertebrae bear both ribs and chevron bones, and
abdominal splint-ribs are largely developed.</p>

<p>In the shoulder-girdle the coracoids are large and meet in a
ventral symphysis; precoracoids and a sternum are apparently
absent, but parts generally regarded<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> as the clavicles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
interclavicle are well developed. In the pelvis, the pubes and
ischia meet in a long symphysis. The limbs are pentedactylate,
and in the best known forms, the Plesiosauridae, form swimming
paddles.</p>

<p>The Sauropterygia occur in beds of Secondary age, and
some of the best known genera are <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, <i>Pliosaurus</i>
and <i>Nothosaurus</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 3.</i> <span class="smcap">Chelonia.</span></p>

<p>In the Tortoises and Turtles the body is enclosed in a bony
box, formed of the dorsal carapace, and a flat ventral buckler,
the plastron. Except in <i>Dermochelys</i> the carapace is partly
formed from the vertebral column and ribs, partly from dermal
bones. Both carapace and plastron are, except in <i>Dermochelys</i>,
<i>Trionyx</i> and their allies, covered with an epidermal
exoskeleton of horny plates, which are regularly arranged,
though their outlines do not coincide with those of the underlying
bones. The thoracic vertebrae have no transverse processes,
and are quite immovably fixed, but the cervical and
caudal vertebrae are very freely movable. There are no lumbar
vertebrae. The skull is extremely solid, and frequently has a
very complete false roof. Teeth have been detected in embryos
of <i>Trionyx</i> but with this exception the jaws are toothless,
and are encased in horny beaks. The quadrate is firmly
fixed. The facial part of the skull is very short, and the
alisphenoidal and orbitosphenoidal regions are unossified. In
living forms there are no separate nasal bones, while large
prefrontals and postfrontals are developed. There is a comparatively
complete bony palate chiefly formed of the palatines
and pterygoids. The anterior nares are united and placed at
the anterior end of the skull, and the premaxillae are very
small. There is no transpalatine bone and the vomer is
unpaired. The dentaries are generally fused together.</p>

<p>There are ten pairs of ribs, and each rib has only a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
head and is partially attached to two vertebrae; there are no
cervical or sternal ribs. There is no true sternum.</p>

<p>The three anterior elements of the plastron are respectively
homologous with the interclavicle and two clavicles of other
reptiles, while the remaining elements of the plastron are probably
homologous with the abdominal ribs of Crocodiles. The
pectoral girdle lies within the ribs, and the precoracoids and
coracoids do not meet in ventral symphyses. The scapula and
precoracoid are ossified continuously. The pubis probably
corresponds with the pre-pubis of Dinosaurs. There are four
limbs each with five digits.</p>

<p>The order includes three suborders:&mdash;</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (1).</i> <span class="smcap">Trionychia.</span></p>

<p>The carapace and plastron have a rough granular surface
covered with skin and without any horny shields.</p>

<p>The plastron is imperfectly ossified, and marginal bones
may be absent, or if present are confined to the posterior
portion of the carapace. The pelvis is not united to the
plastron. The cranium has not a complete false roof and the
head can be drawn back under the carapace.</p>

<p>The first three digits of both manus and pes bear claws,
and the fourth digit in each case has more than three phalanges.
The most important genus is <i>Trionyx</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (2).</i> <span class="smcap">Cryptodira.</span></p>

<p>The carapace and plastron vary in the extent to which they
are ossified, and except in <i>Dermochelys</i><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and its allies are
covered by horny plates. Marginal bones are always present.
The head can generally be drawn back under the carapace.
The pelvis is not firmly united to the plastron. The cranium
often has a complete false roof, and in the mandibular articulation
the cup is borne by the cranium, and the knob by the
mandible. Among the more important genera are <i>Dermochelys</i>,
<i>Chelone</i>, and <i>Testudo</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (3).</i> <span class="smcap">Pleurodira.</span></p>

<p>The carapace and plastron are strongly ossified, and firmly
united to the pelvis. The head and neck can be folded laterally
under the carapace, but cannot be drawn back under it.
The cranium has a more or less complete false roof, and in the
mandibular articulation the knob is borne by the cranium, and
the cup by the mandible. <i>Chelys</i> is a well-known genus.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 4.</i> <span class="smcap">Ichthyosauria</span><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>The order includes a number of large extinct marine
reptiles whose general shape is similar to that of the Cetacea.
The skull is enormously large, and the neck short. The tail
is very long, and is terminated by a large vertically-placed
bilobed fin, the vertebral column running along the lower
lobe. The very numerous vertebrae are short and deeply biconcave.
The vertebral column can be divided into caudal
and precaudal regions only, as the ribs which begin at the
anterior part of the neck are continued to the posterior end
of the trunk without being connected with any sternum or
sacrum. The precaudal vertebrae bear two surfaces for the
articulation of the ribs, while in the caudal vertebrae the
two surfaces have coalesced. The caudal region is also
distinguished by its chevron bones. The vertebrae have
no transverse processes, and the neural arches are not
firmly united to the centra, and have only traces of zygapophyses.
The atlas and axis are similar to the other
vertebrae, but there is a wedge-shaped intercentrum between
the atlas and the skull, and another between the
atlas and the axis. The skull is greatly elongated (fig. 32)
and pointed, mainly owing to the length of the premaxillae.
The orbits are enormous, and there is a ring of bones in the
sclerotic (fig. 32, 15). The anterior nares are very small; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
are placed far back just in front of the orbits. There is an
interparietal foramen, and the supratemporal fossae (fig. 32, 9)
are very large, while there are no infratemporal fossae. An
epipterygoid occurs. The quadrate is firmly fixed to the
cranium, and there is a large parasphenoid. There are large
prefrontals, but the frontals are very small. The very numerous
teeth are large and conical, and are placed in continuous
grooves without being ankylosed to the bone. They are
confined to the jaw-bones.</p>

<p>The ribs are long, and the anterior ones have capitula and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
tubercula. There is no sternum, but the ventral body wall
is strengthened by a complex system of abdominal splint ribs.</p>

<p>The pectoral girdle is strongly developed, the scapulae are
narrow, the coracoids broad, and meet ventrally without overlapping.
There are probably no precoracoids, but clavicles
and a T-shaped interclavicle are well developed.</p>

<p>The limbs are very short, and completely modified into
swimming paddles. The humerus and femur are both short,
while the radius and ulna, tibia and fibula are generally still
further reduced to the form of short polygonal bones.</p>

<p>The digits are formed of longitudinal series of very numerous
small bones. The number of digits is five, but there
sometimes appear to be more owing to the bifurcation of
certain of them, or to the addition of marginal bones, either
to the radial or ulnar side of the limb. The humerus has no
foramen, and both humerus and femur are unique in that
they are distally terminated by concave surfaces instead of
by convex condyles. The pelvic limb is much smaller than
the pectoral. The pelvis has no bony connection with the
vertebral column, and all the component bones are small and
rod-like.</p>

<p>The Ichthyosauria are confined to beds of Secondary age
and by far the best known genus is <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 5.</i> <span class="smcap">Rhynchocephalia.</span></p>

<p>This order includes the living <i>Sphenodon</i> (<i>Hatteria</i>) and
various extinct forms. The general shape of these animals is
lizard-like and the tail is long.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are amphicoelous or sometimes nearly flat,
and the notochord sometimes persists to some extent. <i>Proterosaurus</i>
differs from the other members of the order in having
opisthocoelous cervical vertebrae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The sacrum is composed of two vertebrae. Ossified inter centra
(interdorsalia) generally occur in the cervical and
caudal regions, and sometimes throughout the whole vertebral
column. In the skull the quadrate is immovably fixed and
united to the pterygoid. The palate is well ossified, while
the premaxillae which are often beak-like are never ankylosed
together. The jaws may be toothless or may be provided
with teeth which are usually acrodont (see p. 199). The
palatines frequently bear teeth, and in <i>Proterosaurus</i> teeth
occur also on the pterygoids and vomers. The rami of the
mandible are united by ligament at the symphysis except in
the Rhynchosauridae, in which the union is bony. Superior
and inferior temporal arcades occur.</p>

<p>The ribs have capitula and tubercula, and often uncinate
processes (see p. 190) as in birds. A pectoral girdle and
sternum, with clavicles and a T-shaped interclavicle are developed,
and abdominal ribs are always found. The precoracoid
is however absent. The limbs are pentedactylate.</p>

<p><i>Sphenodon</i><a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> (Hatteria) now living in some of the islands
of the New Zealand group, is certainly the most generalised
of all living reptiles. Though lizard-like in form it differs
from all living lizards in the possession of two temporal
arcades, abdominal ribs and a fixed quadrate; and is often
considered to be nearly allied in many respects to the type
of reptile from which all the others took their origin.</p>

<p>Among the better known extinct forms are <i>Proterosaurus</i>
of Permian and <i>Hyperodapedon</i> of Triassic age.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 6.</i> <span class="smcap">Squamata.</span></p>

<p>This order includes the extinct Mosasaurians, and the
lizards and snakes which form the vast majority of living
reptiles. The trunk may be moderately elongated and provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with four short limbs as in lizards, or it may be limbless,
extremely elongated, and passing imperceptibly into
the tail. The surface is generally completely covered with
overlapping horny epidermal scales, below which bony dermal
scutes may be developed.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are procoelous, rarely amphicoelous. There
are no inter centra, and the neural arches are firmly united to
the centra. Additional articulating surfaces, the zygosphenes
and zygantra, are often developed<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. The sacrum is formed
of two or rarely three vertebrae, or may be wanting as in
Ophidia. In the skull an infratemporal arcade forming the
lower boundary of the infratemporal fossa is absent, and the
quadrate, except in the Chamaeleons, is movably articulated
to the squamosal. The palatal vacuities are large and the
nares are separate. There is often a distinct parasphenoid.
The teeth are either <i>acrodont</i> (i.e. ankylosed to the summit
of the jaw), or <i>pleurodont</i>, i.e. ankylosed to the inner side
of the jaw. The thoracic ribs each have a single head
which articulates with the centrum of the vertebra; while
uncinate processes and abdominal ribs never occur.</p>

<p>A pectoral girdle and sternum may be present, or may be
completely absent as in snakes. Except in snakes there are
generally four pentedactylate limbs which may either form
paddles or be adapted for walking.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (1).</i> <span class="smcap">Lacertilia</span><a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>The body is elongated, and as a rule four short pentedactylate
limbs are present, but sometimes limbs are vestigial or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
absent. The exoskeleton generally has the form of horny
plates, spines, or scales; while sometimes as in the Chamaeleons
and Amphisbaenians it is absent. In other forms such
as <i>Tiliqua</i> and <i>Scincus</i>, the body has a complete armour of
bony scutes, whose shape corresponds with that of the overlying
horny scales.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are procoelous, rarely as in the Geckos
amphicoelous; they are usually without zygosphenes and
zygantra, but these structures occur in the Iguanidae. The
sacral vertebrae of living forms are not ankylosed together,
and the caudal vertebrae usually have well-developed chevron
bones.</p>

<p>In the skull<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the orbits are separated from one another,
only by an imperfectly developed interorbital septum, the
cranial cavity not extending forwards between them, while
the alisphenoidal region is unossified. The premaxillae may
be paired or united (Amphisbaenidae), and there is usually
an interparietal foramen. There may be a complete supratemporal<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
arcade bounding the lower margin of the supratemporal
fossa, or the supratemporal fossa may be open below.
The quadratojugal is not ossified, and the quadrate articulates
with the exoccipital. There is no infratemporal arcade. There
is commonly a rod-like epipterygoid<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> (fig. 33, 14) connecting
the pterygoid and parietal.</p>

<p>Teeth are always present, and may be confined to the
jaws or may be developed also on the pterygoids and rarely
on the palatines; they are either acrodont or pleurodont.
The rami of the mandible are suturally united.</p>

<p>A pectoral girdle is always present, and generally also a
sternum. Clavicles and a T-shaped interclavicle are commonly
present, but are absent in the Chamaeleons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Sternal ribs are present in chamaeleons and scinks. The
limbs are in the great majority of cases pentedactylate and
the digits are clawed. The phalanges articulate by means
of condyles. Sometimes one or both pairs of limbs are
absent. When the posterior limbs are absent the pelvis is
also wanting, though the loss of the anterior limbs does not
lead to a corresponding loss of the pectoral girdle.</p>

<p>The pubis corresponds to the pre-pubis of Dinosaurs, and
both pubes and ischia meet in ventral symphyses.</p>

<p>The suborder includes the Lizards, Chamaeleons and Amphisbaenians.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (2).</i> <span class="smcap">Ophidia</span><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>The Ophidia or snakes are characterised by their greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
elongated body and want of limbs. The body is covered with
overlapping horny scales and bony dermal scutes are never
present. The vertebrae are procoelous, and are distinguishable
into two groups only, precaudal or rib-bearing, and caudal or
ribless. The atlas vertebra is also ribless. The neural arches
are always provided with zygosphenes and zygantra. Many
of the vertebrae have strong hypapophyses, and the caudal
vertebrae are without chevron bones.</p>

<p>In the skull the cranial cavity extends forwards between
the orbits, and is closed in front by downgrowths from the
frontals and parietals which meet the well-ossified alisphenoids
and orbitosphenoids<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. The cranium is strongly ossified, and
there are no parotic processes or interparietal foramen. There
are no temporal arcades and no epipterygoid. The premaxillae
if present are very small (fig. 51, 1) and usually toothless.
The quadrates articulate with the squamosals, and do not as
in Lacertilia meet the exoccipitals. The palatines do not
unite directly with the vomers or with the base of the cranium,
and the whole palato-maxillary apparatus is more loosely connected
with the cranium than it is in Lacertilia. The pterygoids,
and in most cases also the palatines, bear teeth. The
dentition is acrodont, and the rami of the mandible are united
only by an elastic ligament&mdash;an important point serving to
distinguish the Ophidia from the Lacertilia. There is an
imperfectly developed interorbital septum, the ventral part
of which is formed by the parasphenoid. The postfrontal is
generally well developed, while the jugals and quadratojugals
are absent. There are never any traces of the anterior limbs
or pectoral girdle, but occasionally there are vestiges of a
pelvis and posterior limbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (3).</i> <span class="smcap">Pythonomorpha</span><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>This suborder includes <i>Mosasaurus</i> and its allies, a group
of enormous extinct marine reptiles found in beds of Cretaceous
age.</p>

<p>The skin is in most forms at any rate unprovided with
dermal scutes. The vertebrae may be with or without zygosphenes
and zygantra. The skull resembles that of lizards,
having an interparietal foramen, and a cranial cavity open
in front. The squamosal takes part in the formation of the
cranial wall, and the quadrate articulates with the squamosal,
not as in Lacertilia with the exoccipital. There are large
supratemporal fossae, bounded below by supratemporal arcades.
The teeth are large and acrodont, and occur on the pterygoids
as well as on the jaws. The two rami of the mandible are
united by ligament only. Pectoral and pelvic girdles are
present, but clavicles are wanting, and the pelvis is not as a
rule united to any sacrum.</p>

<p>The limbs are pentedactylate, and are adapted for swimming,
while all the limb bones except the phalanges are relatively
very short. The number of phalanges is not increased
beyond the normal, and they articulate with one another by
flat surfaces. The terminal phalanges are without claws.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 7.</i> <span class="smcap">Dinosauria</span><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>The extinct reptiles comprising this order were all terrestrial,
and include the largest terrestrial animals known. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
vary greatly in size and in the structure of the limbs, some
approach close to the type of structure met with in birds,
others are allied to crocodiles.</p>

<p>Passing to the more detailed characters:&mdash;there is sometimes
a well-developed exoskeleton having the form of bony
plates or spines. The vertebrae may be solid or their centra
may be hollowed internally; their surfaces may be flat, biconcave
or opisthocoelous. The sacrum is composed of from
two to six vertebrae.</p>

<p>As regards the skull, the quadrate is large and fixed, and
supratemporal and infratemporal fossae bounded by bone occur.
The teeth are more or less laterally compressed, and often
have serrated edges; they may be placed in distinct sockets
or in a continuous groove. The ribs have capitula and tubercula,
and sternal ribs often occur. The scapula is very large,
the coracoid small, and there is no precoracoid, or T-shaped
interclavicle. Clavicles are only known in a few cases. In
the pelvis the ilium is elongated both in front of, and behind,
the acetabulum, sometimes the pre-pubis, sometimes the post-pubis
is the better developed. The anterior limbs are shorter
than the posterior, and the long bones are sometimes solid,
sometimes hollow.</p>

<p>There are three well-marked suborders of the Dinosauria.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (1).</i> <span class="smcap">Sauropoda</span><a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>The reptiles belonging to this group were probably quadrupedal
and herbivorous.</p>

<p>They have the cervical and anterior trunk vertebrae
opisthocoelous, while the posterior vertebrae are biconcave;
all the presacral, and sometimes the sacral vertebrae are
hollowed internally. The teeth are spatulate and without
serrated edges, they are always planted in distinct sockets,
and some of them are borne by the premaxillae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The nares have the form of long slits and there are large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
pre-orbital vacuities.</p>

<p>The limb bones are solid, and the anterior limbs are not
much shorter than the posterior ones. All the limbs are
plantigrade and pentedactylate, and the digits of the pes are
clawed. There is a large pre-pubis directed downwards and
forwards, meeting its fellow in a ventral symphysis, but there
is no post-pubis.</p>

<p>The Sauropoda are found in the secondary rocks of Europe
and N. America and include the largest land animals that are
known to have existed. Many of the best known forms such
as <i>Brontosaurus</i> and <i>Morosaurus</i> are North American.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (2).</i> <span class="smcap">Theropoda.</span></p>

<p>The members of this suborder were all carnivorous, and
from the small comparative size of the anterior limbs many of
them were probably bipedal.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are opisthocoelous or amphicoelous, their
neural arches are provided with zygosphenes and zygantra,
and their centra are frequently hollowed internally; the limb
bones are also hollow, and in fact the whole skeleton is extremely
light. The tail is of great length. The teeth are
pointed and recurved, and have one or both borders serrated;
they are always planted in distinct sockets, and some of them
are borne by the premaxillae. There are large pre-orbital
vacuities. The digits of both manus and pes are terminated
by pointed ungual phalanges which must have borne claws.
In the pelvis the pre-pubes and ischia are slender bones, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
former meeting in a ventral symphysis. The ilia are very
deep vertically and there are no post-pubes. The astragalus
is closely applied to the tibia, in front of which it sends an
ascending process, sometimes the two bones appear to have
been ankylosed together, as in birds. The metatarsals are
elongated and the feet digitigrade.</p>

<p>The Theropoda vary greatly in size, one of the best known
genera <i>Compsognathus</i> was about as large as a cat, another,
<i>Megalosaurus</i>, perhaps as large as an elephant. <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
is the name of a well-known North American form regarded
by many authorities as identical with <i>Megalosaurus</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (3).</i> <span class="smcap">Orthopoda.</span></p>

<p>This suborder includes the most specialised of the Dinosaurs,
certain of which resemble the Theropoda in being
bipedal. In some of them such as <i>Stegosaurus</i> the exoskeleton
is strongly developed, in others such as <i>Iguanodon</i> it is
absent.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are solid and may be opisthocoelous, biconcave,
or flat. The teeth are compressed and serrated,
often irregularly, and are frequently not set in distinct sockets.
The anterior part of the premaxillae is without teeth, and a
toothless predentary or mento-meckelian bone is present.
The pre-orbital vacuities are small or absent, and the nares
are large and placed far forwards.</p>

<p>The most characteristic features of the group are found
in the pelvis which, except in the Ceratopsia, bears a striking
resemblance to that of birds. The ischium and post-pubis
are long slender bones directed backwards parallel to one
another, and the pre-pubis is also well developed. The ischium
has an obturator process. The limb bones are sometimes
hollow, sometimes solid. The anterior limbs are much shorter
than the posterior, pointing to a bipedal method of progression.
The pes is digitigrade or plantigrade, and has three, rarely four,
digits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The suborder Orthopoda may be further subdivided into
three sections:&mdash;</p>


<p class="cen">A. <span class="smcap">Stegosauria.</span></p>

<p>A dermal exoskeleton is strongly developed. The vertebral
centra are flat or biconcave, and neither they nor the
limb bones are hollowed out by internal cavities. The limbs
are plantigrade, the anterior ones short, the posterior ones
very large and strong. The post-pubis is well developed;</p>

<p>e.g. <i>Stegosaurus</i> from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado.</p>


<p class="cen">B. <span class="smcap">Ceratopsia.</span></p>

<p>There is sometimes a well-developed dermal exoskeleton
formed of small granules and plates of bone. The bones are
solid, and the vertebral centra flat. The cranium bears a
pair of enormous pointed frontal horns, and the parietal is
greatly expanded and elevated behind, forming with the
squamosals a shield which overhangs the anterior cervical
vertebrae. The premaxillae are united, and in front of them
is a pointed beak-like bone which bites upon a toothless
predentary ossification of the mandible. The teeth have two
roots. The anterior limbs are but little shorter than the
posterior ones. There is no post-pubis;</p>

<p>There is no dermal exoskeleton. The cervical vertebrae
are opisthocoelous, and so are sometimes the thoracic. The
limb bones are hollow and the anterior limbs are much shorter
than the posterior ones. The feet are digitigrade and provided
with long pointed claws. The post-pubis is long and
slender and directed back parallel to the ischium;</p>

<p>e.g. <i>Iguanodon</i> from the European Cretaceous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 8.</i> <span class="smcap">Crocodilia</span><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>This order includes the Crocodiles, Alligators and Garials
and various extinct forms, some of which are closely allied to
the early Dinosaurs.</p>

<p>There is always a more or less complete exoskeleton formed
of bony scutes overlain by epidermal scales; these bony scutes
are specially well developed on the dorsal surface but may
occur also on the ventral. The vertebral column is divisible
into the five regions commonly distinguishable. In all living
forms the vertebrae, with the exception of the atlas and axis,
the two sacrals, and first caudal, are procoelous, but in many
extinct forms they are amphicoelous. The atlas (fig. 71) is
remarkable, consisting of four pieces, and the first caudal is
biconvex.</p>

<p>The teeth are, in the adult, planted in separate deep
sockets. The skull is very dense and solid, and all the
component bones including the quadrate are firmly united.
The dorsal surface of the skull is generally characteristically
sculptured. There is an interorbital septum, and the orbitosphenoidal
and presphenoidal regions are imperfectly ossified.
Supratemporal, infratemporal, and post-temporal fossae occur,
but no interparietal foramen. In living genera there is a long
secondary palate formed by the meeting in the middle line of
the palatines, pterygoids and maxillae (fig. 43, A).</p>

<p>Cervical ribs (fig. 41, 8 and 9) are well developed, and articulate
with rather prominent surfaces borne on the neural
arches and centra respectively. The thoracic ribs articulate
with the long transverse processes, and sternal ribs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
abdominal splint ribs (fig. 46, 4) occur. The sternum is cartilaginous,
and both it and the shoulder-girdle are very simple.
The precoracoid is represented by merely a small process on
the coracoid, while the clavicles are absent, except in the
Parasuchia. In the pelvis (fig. 49) there is a large ilium, and
an ischium meeting its fellow in a ventral symphysis; these
two bones form almost the whole of the acetabulum. In
front of the acetabulum, in the Eusuchia, projects a bone
which is generally called the pubis, but is in reality rather
an epipubis (fig. 49, 4), the true pubis being probably represented
by a fourth element which remains cartilaginous for
some time, and later on ossifies and attaches itself to the
ischium. The limbs are small in proportion to the size of the
body, and are adapted for swimming or for shuffling along the
ground; they are plantigrade and the bones are all solid.
In living forms the anterior limbs have five digits and the
posterior four, the fifth being represented only by a short
metatarsal. The first three digits in each case are clawed.
The calcaneum has a large backwardly-projecting process.</p>

<p>The order Crocodilia may be subdivided into two suborders.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder (1).</i> <span class="smcap">Parasuchia.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral centra are flat or biconcave. The premaxillae
are very large, and the nares are separated, and
placed far back. The posterior narial openings lie comparatively
far forward between the anterior extremities of the
palatines.</p>

<p>The palatines and pterygoids do not form a secondary
palate. The supratemporal fossae are small, and open posteriorly,
the lateral temporal fossae are very large. The parietals
and frontals are paired. Clavicles are present. The best
known and most important genus of these extinct crocodiles
is <i>Belodon</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Eusuchia.</span></p>

<p>The vertebrae are either biconcave or procoelous. The premaxillae
are small, and the anterior nares are united and
placed far forwards. The posterior nares lie far back, the
palatines and in living genera the pterygoids, meeting in the
middle line, and giving rise to a closed palate. The supratemporal
fossae are surrounded by bone on all sides, and the
parietals, and often also the frontals are united. There are
no clavicles. The suborder includes the genera <i>Crocodilus</i>,
<i>Alligator</i>, <i>Garialis</i> and others living and extinct.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 9.</i> <span class="smcap">Pterosauria<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</span></p>

<p>These animals, called also the pterodactyles or Ornithosauria,
are a group of extinct reptiles, whose structure has
been greatly modified from the ordinary reptilian type for the
purpose of flight.</p>

<p>The skin was naked and they vary greatly in size and in
the length of the tail. The vertebrae and limb bones are
pneumatic just as in birds. The presacral vertebrae are procoelous
and have their neural arches firmly united to the
centra. The neck is long, the caudal vertebrae are amphicoelous,
and from three to five vertebrae are fused together
in the sacral region. The skull is large and somewhat bird-like,
the facial portion being much drawn out anteriorly, and
the sutures being obliterated. It resembles that of other
reptiles in having large supratemporal fossae; large pre-orbital
vacuities also occur. The jaws may be toothed or toothless,
and the teeth, when present, are imbedded in separate sockets.
The premaxillae are large, and the quadrate is firmly attached
to the skull. The rami of the mandible are united at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
symphysis, and there is an ossified ring in the sclerotic. The
occurrence of a postfrontal and its union with the jugal
behind the orbit, are characteristic reptilian features.</p>

<p>The ribs have capitula and tubercula, and sternal and
abdominal ribs occur. The sternum has a well-developed keel,
and the scapula and coracoid are large and bird-like. There
are no clavicles or interclavicle.</p>

<p>The anterior limbs are modified to form wings by the great
elongation of the fifth digit, to which a membrane was attached.
The second, third and fourth digits are clawed and
are not elongated in the way that they are in bats. The
pollex, if present at all, is quite vestigial.</p>

<p>The pelvis is weak and small, and though the ilia are produced
both in front of and behind the acetabula, in other
features the pelvis is not bird-like. The ischia are short and
wide, and the pubes are represented only by the pre-pubes.
The posterior limbs are small and the fibula is much reduced.
The pes is quite reptilian in type, and has five separate slender
metatarsals. The two best known genera are <i>Pterodactylus</i>, in
which the tail is short, and <i>Rhamphorhynchus</i>, in which it is
long. The Pterosauria are found throughout the Jurassic and
Cretaceous formations in both Europe and North America.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE GREEN TURTLE.

(<i>Chelone midas.</i>)</small></h2>


<p>The most striking feature as regards the skeleton of the
Turtle is that the trunk is enveloped in a bony box, the dorsal
portion of which is called the <b>carapace</b>, while the ventral
portion is the <b>plastron</b>.</p>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <b>epidermal exoskeleton</b> in the Green Turtle as
in all other Chelonia except <i>Dermochelys</i>, <i>Trionyx</i> and their
allies is strongly developed, its most important part consisting
of a series of horny <b>shields</b> which cover over the bony plates
of the carapace and plastron but do not at all correspond to
them in size and arrangement.</p>

<p>The shields covering over the <b>carapace</b> consist of three
rows of larger central shields,&mdash;five (<b>vertebral</b>) shields being
included in the middle row and four (<b>costal</b>) in each lateral
row,&mdash;and of a number of smaller <b>marginal</b> shields.</p>

<p>Of the marginal shields, that lying immediately in front of
the first vertebral is termed the <b>nuchal</b>, while the two succeeding
the last vertebral are called sometimes <b>pygal</b>, sometimes
<b>supracaudal</b>; the remainder are the marginal shields
proper.</p>

<p>The epidermal covering of the <b>plastron</b> consists principally
of six pairs of symmetrically arranged shields, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
respectively the <b>gular</b>, <b>humeral</b>, <b>pectoral</b>, <b>abdominal</b>,
<b>femoral</b>, and <b>anal</b>, the gular being the most anterior. In
front of the gular shields is an unpaired <b>intergular</b>, and
the shields of the plastron are connected laterally with those
of the carapace, by five or six pairs of rather irregular <b>infra-marginal</b>
shields. Smaller horny plates occur on other parts
of the body, especially on the limbs and head.</p>

<p>Two other sets of structures belong also to the epidermal
exoskeleton, viz. (<i>a</i>) horny <b>beaks</b> with denticulated edges
which ensheath both upper and lower jaws, (<i>b</i>) <b>claws</b>, which
as a rule are borne only by the first digit of each limb.
Sometimes in young individuals the second digit is also clawed.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <b>dermal exoskeleton</b> is strongly developed, and
is combined with endoskeletal structures derived from the ribs
and vertebrae to form the carapace.</p>

<p>The <b>Carapace</b> (fig. 36) consists of a number of plates
firmly united to one another by sutures. They have a very
definite arrangement and include:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) the <b>nuchal</b> plate (fig. 36, 1), a wide plate forming
the whole of the anterior margin of the carapace. It is
succeeded by three series of plates, eight in each series, which
together make up the main part of the carapace. Of these
the small</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>neural plates</b>[1] (fig. 36, A, 2) form the middle series.
They are closely united with the neural arches of the underlying
vertebrae;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) the <b>costal plates</b><a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> (fig. 36, A, 3) are broad arched
plates united to one another by long straight sutures. They
are united at their inner extremities with the neural plates,
but the boundaries of the two sets of plates do not regularly
correspond. Each is united ventrally with a rib which projects
beyond it laterally for some distance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
(<i>d</i>) the <b>marginal plates</b> (fig. 36, 4) are twenty-three in
number, eleven lying on each side, while an unpaired one lies
in the middle line posteriorly. Many of them are marked by
slight depressions into which the ends of the ribs fit;
(e) the <b>pygal</b> plates (fig. 36, 5) are two unpaired plates
lying immediately posterior to the last neural.</p>

<p>The sculpturing due to the epidermal shields is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
obvious on the carapace.</p>

<p>The <b>plastron</b> (fig. 37) consists of one unpaired ossification,
the <b>entoplastron</b>, and four pairs of ossifications called respectively
the <b>epiplastra</b>, <b>hyoplastra</b>, <b>hypoplastra</b>, and
<b>xiphiplastra</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>epiplastra</b> (fig. 37, 1) are the most anterior, they are
expanded and united to one another in the middle line in
front, while behind each tapers to a point which lies external
to a process projecting forwards from the hyoplastron. They
are homologous with the <i>clavicles</i> of other vertebrates.</p>

<p>The <b>entoplastron</b> or <b>episternum</b> (fig. 37, 2) which is
homologous with the <i>interclavicle</i> of other reptiles, is expanded
at its anterior end and attached to the symphysis
of the epiplastra, while behind it tapers to a point and ends
freely.</p>

<p>The <b>hyoplastra</b> are large irregular bones each closely
united posteriorly with the corresponding hypoplastron, and
drawn out anteriorly into a process which lies internal to that
projecting backwards from the epiplastron. Each gives off on
its inner surface a slender process which nearly meets its fellow,
while the anterior half of the outer surface is drawn out into
several diverging processes.</p>

<p>The <b>hypoplastra</b> (fig. 37, 4) are flattened bones resembling
the hyoplastra, with which they are united by long
sutures; the posterior half of both outer and inner surfaces
is drawn out into a number of pointed processes.</p>

<p>The <b>xiphiplastra</b> are small flattened elongated bones
meeting one another in the middle line posteriorly. In front
they are notched and each interlocks with a process from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
hypoplastron of its side. The hyoplastra, hypoplastra and
xiphiplastra are homologous with the abdominal ribs of
Crocodiles.</p>

<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>The axial skeleton includes the vertebral column, the ribs,
and the skull.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral column and Ribs.</span></p>

<p>The number of vertebrae in the Green Turtle is thirty-eight,
not a great number as compared with that in many
reptiles, and of these eighteen are caudal.</p>

<p>The vertebral column is divisible into four regions only&mdash;<b>cervical</b>,
<b>thoracic</b>, <b>sacral</b>, and <b>caudal</b>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Cervical vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>These are eight in number, and are chiefly remarkable for
the great variety of articulating surfaces which their centra
present, and for their mobility upon one another.</p>

<p>The first or <b>atlas</b> vertebra differs much from all the others
and consists of the following parts:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> the <b>neural arch</b>, formed of two separate ossifications
united in the mid-dorsal line;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> the <b>inferior arch</b>;</p>

<p><i>c.</i> the <b>centrum</b>, which is detached from the rest and
forms the odontoid process of the second vertebra.</p>

<p>Each half of the <b>neural arch</b> consists of a ventral portion,
the <b>pedicel</b>, which lies more or less vertically and is united
ventrally to the inferior arch, and of a dorsal portion, the
<b>lamina</b>, which lies more or less horizontally and meets its
fellow in the middle line in front, partially roofing over the
neural canal. Each pedicel bears a facet on its anterior
surface, which, with a corresponding one on the inferior arch,
articulates with the occipital condyle of the skull. Three
similar facets occur also on the posterior surface of the
pedicel and inferior arch, and articulate with the odontoid
process. The laminae meet one another in front, but do not
fuse, while behind they are separated by a wide triangular
space. They bear a pair of small downwardly-directed facets,
the <b>postzygapophyses</b>, for articulation with the prezygapophyses
of the second vertebra.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>inferior arch</b> is a short irregular bone bearing two
converging facets for articulation with the occipital condyle
and odontoid process respectively.</p>

<p>The <b>centrum</b> or <b>odontoid process</b> has a convex anterior
surface for articulation with the neural and inferior arches,
and a concave posterior surface by which it is united with
the centrum of the second or axis vertebra. It bears posteriorly
a small epiphysis which is really a detached portion of
the inferior arch.</p>

<p>The second or <b>axis</b> and following five cervical vertebrae,
though showing distinct differences, resemble one another considerably,
each having a fairly elongated centrum with a keel-like
<b>hypapophysis</b>, each having also a neural arch with
prominent articulating surfaces, the anterior of which, or
<b>prezygapophyses</b>, look upwards and inwards, while the
posterior ones, the <b>postzygapophyses</b>, look downwards and
outwards. They however, as was previously mentioned, differ
very remarkably in the character of the articulating surfaces
of the centra. Thus the second and third vertebrae are
convex in front and concave behind, the fourth is biconvex,
the fifth is concave in front and convex behind. The sixth
is concave in front and attached to the seventh by a flat
surface behind, the seventh has a flat anterior face and two
slightly convex facets behind. The vertebrae all have short
blunt transverse processes and the second has a prominent
<b>neural spine</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>eighth cervical vertebra</b> is curiously modified, the
centrum is very short, has a rather prominent hypapophysis,
and is convex behind, while in front it articulates with the
preceding centrum by two concave surfaces. The neural arch
is deeply notched in front and bears two upwardly-directed
prezygapophyses, while behind it is very massive and is drawn
out far beyond the centrum, bearing a pair of flat postzygapophyses.
The top of the neural arch almost or quite meets
a blunt outgrowth from the nuchal plate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Thoracic vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>These are ten in number and are all firmly united with
the ribs and elements forming the carapace.</p>

<p>The first thoracic vertebra differs from the others, the
centrum is short and has a concave anterior surface articulating
with the centrum of the last cervical vertebra, and a
pair of prezygapophyses borne on long outgrowths. The
neural spine arises only from the anterior half of the centrum,
and is not fused to the carapace. Arising laterally from the
anterior part of the centrum are a small pair of ribs each of
which is connected with a process arising from the rib of the
succeeding vertebra.</p>

<p>The next seven thoracic vertebrae are all very similar,
each has a long cylindrical centrum, expanded at the ends,
and firmly united to the preceding and succeeding vertebrae.
The neural arches are flattened and expanded dorsally, and
are united to one another and to the overlying neural
plates; each arises only from the anterior half of its respective
centrum, and overlaps the centrum of the vertebra in front of
it. Between the base of the neural arch and its successor is a
small foramen for the exit of the spinal nerve. There are no
transverse processes or zygapophyses.</p>

<p>To each thoracic vertebra from the second to ninth inclusive,
there corresponds a pair of <b>ribs</b> (fig. 36, 6) of a rather
special character. Each is suturally united with the anterior
half of the edge of its own vertebra, and overlaps on to the
posterior half of the edge of the next preceding vertebra.
The ribs are much flattened, and each is fused with the corresponding
costal plate, beyond which it projects to fit into
a pit in one of the marginal plates.</p>

<p>The tenth thoracic vertebra is smaller than the others, and
its neural arch does not overlap the preceding vertebra, it
bears a pair of small ribs which are without costal plates, but
meet those of the ninth vertebra.</p>

<p>There are no <b>lumbar</b> vertebrae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sacral vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>sacral vertebrae</b> are two in number, they are short
and wide, their centra are ankylosed together, and their neural
arches are not united to the carapace.</p>

<p>The first has the anterior face of the centrum concave and
the posterior flat, while both faces of the second are flat.
Each bears a pair of short ribs which meet the ilia, but are
not completely ankylosed either with them or the centra.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Caudal vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>caudal vertebrae</b> are eighteen in number. The
centrum of the first is flat in front and is ankylosed to
the second sacral; behind it is convex. The others are all
very similar to one another, and decrease gradually in size
when followed back. Each has a moderately long centrum,
concave in front and convex behind, both terminations being
formed by epiphyses. The neural arch arises only from the
anterior half of the vertebra; it bears a blunt truncated
neural spine and prominent pre- and post-zygapophyses. The
first seven caudal vertebrae bear short ribs attached to their
lateral margins, the similar outgrowths on the succeeding vertebrae
do not ossify from distinct centres, and are transverse
processes rather than ribs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">B. The Skull.</span></p>

<p>The skull of the Turtle is divisible into the following three
parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the cranium;</p>

<p>(2) the lower jaw or mandible;</p>

<p>(3) the hyoid.</p>

<p>(1) <span class="smcap">The Cranium.</span></p>

<p>The <b>cranium</b> is a very compact bony box, containing a
cavity in which the brain lies, and which is a direct continuation
of the neural canal of the vertebrae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Like those of the skull as a whole its component bones may
be subdivided into three sets:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. those forming the brain-case or <b>cranium proper</b>;</p>

<p>2. those developed in connection with the special sense
organs;</p>

<p>3. those forming the upper jaw and suspensorial apparatus.</p>

<p>Both cartilage and membrane bones take part in the formation
of the skull, and a considerable amount of cartilage
remains unossified, especially in the ethmoidal and sphenoidal
regions.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">1. The Cranium proper or Brain-case.</span></p>

<p>The cartilage and membrane bones of the brain-case when
taken together can be seen to be more or less arranged in
three rings or segments, called respectively the occipital,
parietal, and frontal segments.</p>

<p>The <b>occipital segment</b> is the most posterior of these, and
consists of four cartilage bones, the <b>basi-occipital</b>, the two
<b>exoccipitals</b> and the <b>supra-occipital</b>; these bound the
<b>foramen magnum</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>basi-occipital</b> (figs. 38 and 39, 5) lies ventral to the
foramen magnum and only bounds a very small part of it; it
forms one-third of the <b>occipital condyle</b> by which the skull
articulates with the atlas vertebra. It unites dorsally with
the exoccipitals and anteriorly with the basisphenoid.</p>

<p>The <b>exoccipitals</b> are rather small bones, which form the
sides and the greater part of the floor of the foramen magnum,
and two-thirds of the occipital condyle. Laterally each is
united with the pterygoid and opisthotic of its side. At the
sides of the occipital condyle each exoccipital is pierced by
a pair of foramina, the more dorsal and posterior of which
transmits the hypoglossal nerve.</p>

<p>The <b>supra-occipital</b> (fig. 39, 14) is a larger bone than the
others of the occipital segment. It forms the upper border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the foramen magnum and is drawn out dorsally into a large
crest which extends back far beyond the occipital condyle.
In the adult the supra-occipital is completely ankylosed with
the epi-otics.</p>


<p>The <b>Parietal segment</b>.</p>

<p>The ventral portion of the parietal segment is formed by
the <b>basisphenoid</b> (figs. 38 and 39, 4) which lies immediately
in front of the basi-occipital. A triangular portion of it is
seen in a ventral view of the skull, but it is quickly overlapped
by the pterygoids. It gives off dorsally a pair of
short processes which meet the pro-otics.</p>

<p>The alisphenoidal region is unossified and the only other
constituents of the parietal segment are the <i>parietals</i> (fig. 39, 1).
These are large bones which, after roofing over the cranial
cavity, extend upwards and become expanded into a pair of
broad plates which unite with the squamosal and bones of the
frontal segment to form a wide, solid, false roof to the skull.
Each also sends ventralwards a plate which meets an upgrowth
from the pterygoid and acts as an alisphenoid.</p>


<p>The <b>Frontal segment</b>.</p>

<p>Of the frontal segment the basal or presphenoidal and
lateral or orbitosphenoidal portions do not become ossified,
the dorsal portion however includes three pairs of membrane
bones, the <i>frontals</i>, <i>prefrontals</i> and <i>postfrontals</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>frontals</i> are a pair of small bones lying immediately in
front of the parietals, and in front of them are the <i>prefrontals</i>
(figs. 38 and 39, 20), a pair of similar but still smaller bones,
which are produced ventrally to meet the vomer and palatines.
They form also the dorsal boundary of the anterior nares.
The <i>postfrontals</i> (figs. 38 and 39, 18) are larger bones, united
dorsally to the frontals and parietals, posteriorly to the squamosals,
and ventrally to the jugals and quadratojugals. All
three pairs of frontal bones, especially the postfrontals, take
part in the bounding of the orbits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Sense capsules.</span></p>

<p>Skeletal structures occur in connection with each of the
three special sense organs of hearing, sight, and smell.</p>


<p>The <b>Auditory capsules</b>.</p>

<p>The auditory or periotic capsule of the turtle is rather
large and its walls are well ossified, epi-otic, pro-otic and
opisthotic bones being present.</p>

<p>The <b>epi-otic</b> (fig. 39, 13) is the more dorsal of the three
bones, and in the adult is completely ankylosed with the supra-occipital.</p>

<p>The <b>opisthotic</b> (fig. 39, 8) is the ventral posterior element.
On its inner side it is united to the supra-occipital above,
and to the exoccipital below; it sometimes becomes completely
fused with the exoccipital. In front it meets the
pro-otic, and on its outer side the squamosal and quadrate.
Its anterior portion is hollowed out by the cavity in which
the auditory organ lies, it gives off also a process which is
separated from the exoccipital by an oval foramen through
which the glossopharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory
nerves leave the cranial cavity.</p>

<p>The <b>pro-otic</b> is the anterior element; it meets the supra-occipital
and opisthotic posteriorly, while anteriorly it is
separated from the alisphenoidal plate of the parietal and
pterygoid by a large oval foramen through which the maxillary
and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve pass out
(fig. 39, V 1 &amp; 2). It is hollowed out posteriorly by the cavity
in which the auditory organ lies, and its inner wall as seen in
longitudinal section is pierced by a foramen through which the
external carotid artery and facial nerve leave the cranial cavity,&mdash;the
nerve finally leaving the skull through a small oval
foramen on the anterior face of the pro-otic near its junction
with the quadrate.</p>

<p>Between the pro-otic and opisthotic as seen in a longitudinal
section of the skull is a large opening constricted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
middle. This is the <b>internal auditory meatus</b> (fig. 39, VIII.).
Through it the auditory nerve leaves the cranial cavity and
enters the ear. The ramus vestibularis leaves through the dorsal
part of the hole, the ramus cochlearis through the ventral.</p>

<p>The cavity of the auditory or periotic capsule communicates
with the exterior by a fairly large hole, the <b>fenestra
ovalis</b>, which lies between the opisthotic and pro-otic, and
opens into a deep depression, the <b>tympanic cavity</b>, which
is seen in a posterior view of the skull lying just external to
the exoccipital. The cavity communicates with the exterior by
a large opening, the <b>external auditory meatus</b> (fig. 38, 22).</p>

<p>Several other openings are seen in the tympanic cavity;
through one at the extreme posterior end the pneumogastric
and spinal accessory nerves leave the skull, and through
another, a little further forwards, the glossopharyngeal.</p>

<p>The auditory ossicles consist of a long bony <b>columella</b>,
whose inner end fits into the fenestra ovalis, while the outer
end is attached to a small cartilaginous plate, the <b>extra-columella</b>,
which is united to the tympanum.</p>


<p>The <b>Optic capsules</b>.</p>

<p>The skeletal structures developed in connection with the
optic capsule do not become united to the skull. They consist
of:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) the <b>sclerotic</b>, a cartilaginous sheath investing the eye
and bearing</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) a ring of ten small bony scales.</p>

<p>There is no <i>lachrymal</i> bone.</p>


<p>The <b>Olfactory</b> or <b>Nasal capsules</b>.</p>

<p>The basicranial axis in front of the basisphenoid remains
cartilaginous, neither presphenoid nor mesethmoid bones are
developed, and the orbits in a dry skull communicate by a
wide space through which the second, third, fourth, and sixth
cranial nerves pass out. Separate <i>nasal</i> bones also do not
occur, the large prefrontals extending over the area usually
occupied by both nasals and lachrymals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The only bone developed in connection with the nasal
capsules is the <i>vomer</i> (fig. 39, 19), an unpaired bone lying
ventral to the mesethmoid cartilage, and in contact laterally
with the maxillae, premaxillae and palatines.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Upper Jaw and suspensorial apparatus.</span></p>

<p>A number of pairs of bones are developed in connection
with the upper jaw and suspensorial apparatus, one pair, the
<b>quadrates</b>, being cartilage bones, while the rest are all membrane
bones.</p>

<p>The <i>squamosals</i> (fig. 38, 2) are large bones which, lying
external to the auditory bones, extend dorsalwards to meet
the parietals and postfrontals, and form a large part of the
false roof of the skull. They are united ventrally with the
quadrates and quadratojugals.</p>

<p>Each <b>quadrate</b> (fig. 38, 3) forms the outer boundary of
the tympanic cavity, and is firmly united on its inner side with
the opisthotic, exoccipital, and pterygoid. Dorsally it is fixed
to the squamosal and anteriorly to the quadratojugal. Its
outer surface is marked by a deep recess, and it ends below
in a strong condyle with which the mandible articulates. In
front of the quadrates are a pair of thin plate-like bones, the
<i>quadratojugals</i> which are united in front to the jugals or malars.</p>

<p>The <i>jugals</i> (fig. 38, 17) are also thin plate-like bones, and
form part of the posterior boundary of the orbit. They are
attached dorsally to the postfrontals, and anteriorly to the
maxillae, while each also sends inwards a horizontal process
which meets the pterygoid and palatine.</p>

<p>The <i>maxillae</i> (figs. 38 and 39, 16) are a pair of large vertically-placed
bones, each drawn out ventrally into a straight,
sharp, cutting edge. They form the lateral boundaries of the
anterior nares, and each sends dorsalwards a process which
meets the postfrontal. Each also sends inwards a horizontal
<b>palatine process</b>, which meets the palatine and vomer, and
also forms much of the floor of the narial passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>premaxillae</i> (figs. 38 and 39, 15) are a pair of very
small bones forming the floor of the anterior narial opening,
they are wedged in between the two maxillae, and send back
processes which meet the vomer and palatines.</p>

<p>The <i>palatines</i> (fig. 39, 10) are a pair of small bones firmly
united with the pterygoids behind, with the maxillae and jugals
externally, and with the vomer in the middle line. Each also
gives off a palatine plate which unites with the expanded lower
edge of the vomer, and forms the ventral boundary of the posterior
nares. Anteriorly the palatines form the posterior boundary
of a large foramen through which the ophthalmic branches
of the fifth and seventh nerves pass to the olfactory organs.</p>

<p>The <i>pterygoids</i> (fig. 39, 9) are a pair of large bones which
unite with one another by a long median suture. They are
united also with the palatines in front, and with the quadrate,
basisphenoid, basi-occipital, and exoccipitals behind. Each
also sends dorsalwards a short <b>alisphenoid plate</b> which
meets that from the parietal.</p>

<p>Piercing the posterior end of the <i>pterygoid</i> is the prominent
opening of the carotid canal; a bristle passed into this hole
emerges through a foramen lying between the pro-otic and the
alisphenoid process of the pterygoid.</p>


<p>(2) <span class="smcap">The Lower Jaw or Mandible.</span></p>

<p>The <b>mandible</b> consists of one unpaired bone, formed by
the fusion of the two <i>dentaries</i>, and five pairs of bones, called
respectively the <b>articular</b>, <i>angular</i>, <i>supra-angular</i>, <i>splenial</i>
and <i>coronoid</i>.</p>

<p>The fused <i>dentaries</i> (fig. 38, 12) form by far the largest of
the bones; they constitute the flattened anterior part of the
mandible, and extend back below the other bones almost to
the end of the jaw.</p>

<p>The <i>coronoid</i> is the most anterior of the paired bones, it
forms a prominent process to which the muscles for closing
the jaw are attached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>articular</b> (fig. 38, 11) is expanded, and with the <i>supra-angular</i>
forms the concave articulating surface for the quadrate.</p>

<p>The <i>splenial</i> (fig. 38, 10) is a thin plate applied to the inner
surface of the posterior part of the mandible.</p>

<p>The <i>angular</i> (fig. 38, 13) is a slender plate of bone lying
below the supra-angular and splenial.</p>


<p>(3) <span class="smcap">The Hyoid.</span></p>

<p>The hyoid apparatus is well developed, parts of the first two
branchial arches being found, as well as of the hyoid proper.
It consists of a more or less oblong flattened <b>basilingual
plate</b> or <b>body of the hyoid</b> which represents the fused
ventral ends of the hyoid and branchial arches of the embryo,
and is drawn out into a point anteriorly. The greater part is
formed of unossified cartilage, but at the posterior end it is
bilobed, and a pair of ossified tracts occur. To its sides are
attached three pairs of structures, which are portions of the
hyoid and first and second branchial arches respectively.</p>

<p>The free part of the <b>hyoid</b> consists of a small piece of
cartilage attached to the anterior part of the basilingual plate
at its widest portion (fig. 53, 2).</p>

<p>The <b>anterior cornu</b> or free part of the <b>first branchial
arch</b> is much the largest of the three structures. Its proximal
portion adjoining the basilingual plate is cartilaginous, as is
its distal end; the main part is however ossified.</p>

<p>The <b>posterior cornu</b> or free part of the <b>second branchial
arch</b> (fig. 53, 4) consists of a short flattened cartilaginous bar
arising from the bilobed posterior end of the basilingual plate.</p>

<p>The hyoid apparatus has no skeletal connection with the
rest of the skull.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This includes the skeleton of the two pairs of limbs and
their girdles.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pectoral girdle has an anomalous position, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
situated internal or ventral to the ribs. It consists of three
bones, a dorsal bone, the <b>scapula</b>, an anterior ventral bone,
the <b>precoracoid</b>, and a posterior ventral bone, the <b>coracoid</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>scapula</b> is a small somewhat rod-shaped bone forming
about two-thirds of the glenoid cavity. At its proximal
end it is closely united with the precoracoid, the two bones
ossifying continuously. It tapers away distally, and is directed
dorsalwards towards the carapace.</p>

<p>The <b>precoracoid</b> forms an angle of about 130° with the
scapula, with which it is completely fused at its proximal end.
Its distal end is somewhat expanded and flattened, and is
terminated by a fibrocartilaginous <b>epiprecoracoid</b> which
meets its fellow. It takes no part in the formation of the
glenoid cavity.</p>

<p>The <b>coracoid</b> is a large flattened blade-shaped bone forming
about one-third of the glenoid cavity. It does not meet
its fellow in a ventral symphysis, and is terminated by a cartilaginous
<b>epicoracoid</b>. The glenoid articulating surfaces of
both scapula and coracoid are lined by a thick pad of cartilage.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Anterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>This is divisible into three portions, the <b>upper arm</b>, <b>fore-arm</b>
and <b>manus</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>upper arm</b> contains a single bone, the <b>humerus</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>humerus</b> (fig. 40, A, 1) is a stout, nearly straight, somewhat
flattened bone widely expanded at both ends. At the
proximal end is the large hemispherical <b>head</b>, which articulates
with the glenoid cavity. Behind the head the bone is drawn
out into another large rounded process. Below the head the
shaft bears a small outgrowth which is continuous with a
larger one on the flexor surface (see p. 29). The bone is
terminated distally by the <b>trochlea</b>, consisting of three
partially distinct convex surfaces which articulate with the
bones of the fore-arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>fore-arm</b> includes two bones, the <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b>;
both these are small bones, and are immovably fixed to one
another proximally and distally.</p>

<p>The <b>radius</b> or pre-axial bone is the larger of the two, and
is a rod-like bone terminated at either end by an epiphysis.
It articulates at its proximal end with the humerus, and at
its distal end with the radiale or scaphoid bone of the carpus.</p>

<p>The <b>ulna</b> (fig. 40, A, 3) or postaxial bone is shorter than
the radius, and more expanded at its proximal end, where it
articulates with the humerus. It articulates distally with the
intermedium (lunar) and the ulnare (cuneiform) bones of the
carpus. All three bones of the arm have their terminations
formed by epiphyses which ossify from centres distinct from
those forming the shafts.</p>

<p>The <b>Manus</b> consists of the <b>carpus</b> or <b>wrist</b> and the <b>hand</b>
which includes the metacarpals and phalanges.</p>

<p>The <b>carpus</b> consists of a series of ten small bones, one of
which, the <b>pisiform</b> (fig. 40, A, 10), differs from the others in
being merely an ossification in the tendon of a muscle. The
remaining nine bones are arranged in a proximal row of three,
the <b>ulnare</b> (fig. 40, A, 6), <b>intermedium</b>, and <b>radiale</b>, and a
distal row of five (carpalia 1-5), each of which supports one
of the metacarpals. A ninth bone, the <b>centrale</b> (fig. 40, A, 7),
is wedged in between the two rows. The ulnare, intermedium
and pisiform are comparatively large flattened bones, the others
are small and cubical.</p>

<p>The <b>hand</b>. This is composed of five digits, each of which
consists of a metacarpal and of a varying number of phalanges.</p>

<p>The <b>metacarpals</b>. The first metacarpal (fig. 40, A, 11)
is a short flattened bone, the others are all elongated and
cylindrical, and are terminated proximally by slightly concave
surfaces, and distally by slightly convex ones.</p>

<p>The <b>phalanges</b>. The first and fifth digits both have two
phalanges, the second, third, and fourth have each three. The
distal phalanx of the first digit is stout and curved, and bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
a horny claw; those of the other digits are flattened and more
or less pointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic girdle consists of three bones; a dorsal bone,
the <b>ilium</b>, an anterior ventral bone, the <b>pubis</b>, and a posterior
ventral bone, the <b>ischium</b>. All three bones contribute
largely to the formation of the <b>acetabulum</b>, with which the
head of the femur articulates.</p>

<p>The <b>ilium</b> is a small slightly curved bone, which unites
ventrally with the pubis and ischium, and extends dorsalwards
and backwards to meet the distal ends of the sacral ribs.</p>

<p>The <b>pubis</b> is the largest bone of the three; its distal
end forms a wide bilobed plate, the inner lobe meeting its
fellow in a median symphysis, while the other lobe or lateral
process extends outwards. Attached to the symphysis in front
is a cartilaginous <b>epipubis</b>, while behind, the two pubes are
terminated by a wide rounded cartilaginous area.</p>

<p>The <b>ischium</b>, the smallest bone of the three, is flattened
and like the pubis meets its fellow in a median symphysis.
A narrow band of cartilage connects the symphysis pubis with
the symphysis ischii, and separates the two <b>obturator foramina</b>
from one another.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Posterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>This is divisible into three portions, the <b>thigh</b>, the <b>crus</b> or
<b>shin</b>, and the <b>pes</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>thigh</b> includes a single bone, the <b>femur</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>femur</b> (fig. 40, B, 12) is a short thick bone, with a
prominent rounded <b>head</b> articulating with the acetabulum.
Behind this head is a deep pit, beyond which is a roughened
area corresponding with the great trochanter of mammals.
The distal end is expanded and somewhat convex.</p>

<p>The bones of the <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b> are the <b>tibia</b> and
<b>fibula</b>. These are both straight rod-like bones with expanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
terminations which closely approach one another, while elsewhere
the bones diverge considerably.</p>

<p>The terminations of all three of the leg bones are formed
by epiphyses.</p>

<p>The <b>Pes</b> consists of the <b>tarsus</b> or <b>ankle</b>, and the <b>foot</b>,
which is made up of five digits.</p>

<p>The <b>tarsus</b>. The tarsal bones of the Turtle do not retain
their primitive arrangement to such an extent as do the
carpals. They are arranged in a proximal row of two and a
distal row of four. Of the bones in the proximal row the
postaxial one is much the smaller and is the <b>fibulare</b>; the
larger pre-axial one (fig. 40, B, 15) represents the <b>tibiale</b>,
<b>intermedium</b>, and <b>centrale</b> fused, and articulates with both
tibia and fibula. The first three distal tarsalia are all small
bones and are very similar in size, and each articulates regularly
with the corresponding metatarsal. The fourth bone
(fig. 40, B, 19) is much larger, and represents tarsalia 4 and 5
fused. The first two distal tarsalia articulate with the pre-axial
tarsal of the proximal row, the third only with its neighbours
the second, and the fused fourth and fifth. The latter
articulates with both bones of the proximal row.</p>

<p>Each <b>digit</b> consists of a metatarsal and of a varying number
of phalanges.</p>

<p>The <b>metatarsals</b>. The first metatarsal (fig. 40, B, 20)
is broad and flattened, the second, third and fourth, are all
elongated bones with nearly flat terminations formed by small
epiphyses. The fifth is large and flattened, and the articular
surface for the phalanx is situated somewhat laterally.</p>

<p>The <b>phalanges</b>. The first digit has two phalanges and is
the stoutest of them all; its distal phalanx is sheathed in a
large horny claw. The other digits, of which the third is the
longest, have each three phalanges. The distal phalanges of
the second and third digits are flattened and pointed and bear
small horny claws.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE CROCODILE.</small></h2>


<p>The species chosen for description is <i>C. palustris</i>, a form
occurring throughout the Oriental region, but the description
would apply almost equally well to any of the other species of
the genus <i>Crocodilus</i>, and with comparatively unimportant
modifications to any of the living Crocodilia.</p>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton of the Crocodile is strongly developed and
includes elements of both epidermal and dermal origin.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <b>epidermal exoskeleton</b> is formed of a number
of horny <b>scales</b> or plates of variable size covering the whole
surface of the body. Those covering the dorsal and ventral
surfaces are oblong in shape, and are arranged in regular rows
running transversely across the body. The scales covering
the limbs and head are mostly smaller and less regularly
arranged, and are frequently raised into a more or less obvious
keel. Those covering the dorsal surface of the tail are very
prominently keeled.</p>

<p>The epidermal exoskeleton also includes the horny <b>claws</b>
borne by the first three digits of both manus and pes.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <b>dermal exoskeleton</b>. This has the form of
bony <b>scutes</b> which underlie the epidermal scales along the
dorsal surface of the trunk and anterior part of the tail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Except in very young individuals the epidermal scales are
rubbed off from these scutes, which consequently come to project
freely on the surface of the body. Each scute is a nearly
square bony plate, deeply pitted or sculptured, and marked by
a strong ridge on its dorsal surface, while its ventral surface
is smooth. Contiguous scutes are united to one another by
interlocking sutures.</p>

<p>The scutes are arranged in two distinct areas, viz. (1) a
small anterior <b>nuchal shield</b> which lies just behind the head
and is formed of six large scutes more or less firmly united
together, and (2) a larger posterior <b>dorsal shield</b> covering the
whole of the back and anterior part of the tail, and formed
of smaller scutes, which are arranged in regular transverse
rows, and progressively diminish in size when followed back.</p>

<p>The <b>teeth</b> are exoskeletal structures, partly of dermal,
partly of epidermal origin. They lie along the margins of
the jaws and are confined to the premaxillae, maxillae and
dentaries. They are simple conical structures, without roots;
each is in the adult placed in a separate socket, and is replaced
by another which as it grows comes to occupy the pulp cavity
of its predecessor. In the young animal the teeth are not
placed in separate sockets but in a continuous groove. This
feature is met with also in the Ichthyosauria. The groove
gradually becomes converted into a series of sockets by the
ingrowth of transverse bars of bone. The anterior teeth are
sharply pointed and slightly recurved, the posterior ones are
more blunt.</p>

<p>The upper jaw bears about nineteen pairs of teeth, the
lower jaw about fifteen pairs. The largest tooth in the upper
jaw is the tenth, and in the lower jaw the fourth.</p>

<p>The three living families of Crocodilia, the Crocodiles,
Alligators and Garials, can be readily distinguished by the
characters of the first and fourth lower teeth. In Alligators
both first and fourth lower teeth bite into pits in the upper
jaw; in Garials they both bite into notches or grooves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the upper jaw. In Crocodiles the first tooth bites into a pit,
the fourth into a notch in the upper jaw.</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This includes the vertebral column, the skull, and the ribs
and sternum.</p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral column.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral column is very long, consisting of some sixty
vertebrae. It can be divided into the usual five regions, the
cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cervical vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>Counting as cervical all those vertebrae which are anterior
to the first one whose ribs meet the sternum, there are nine
cervical vertebrae, all of which bear ribs.</p>

<p>As a type of the cervical vertebrae the fifth may be taken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
It has a short cylindrical <b>centrum</b> deeply concave in front
and convex behind. From the anterior part of the ventral
surface of the centrum arises a short <b>hypapophysis</b>, and
on each side is a facet with which the lower limb (<b>capitulum</b>)
of the cervical rib articulates. The <b>neural arch</b> is
strongly developed and drawn out dorsally into a long <b>neural
spine</b>, in front of which are a pair of upstanding processes
bearing the prominent upwardly and inwardly directed <b>prezygapophyses</b>.
At the sides and slightly behind the neural
spine are a corresponding pair of processes bearing the <b>postzygapophyses</b>,
which look downwards and outwards. At
the point where it joins the centrum the neural arch is drawn
out into a short blunt <b>transverse process</b> with which the
upper limb (<b>tuberculum</b>) of the cervical rib articulates. The
sides of the neural arch are slightly notched behind for the exit
of the spinal nerves.</p>

<p>The first or <b>atlas</b> vertebra differs much from any of the
others, and consists of four quite detached portions, a ventral
arch, with two lateral portions and one dorsal. The <b>ventral
arch</b> (fig. 41, 4) is flat below and slightly concave in front,
forming together with two flattened surfaces on the lateral
portions a large articulating surface for the occipital condyle
of the skull. Its posterior face is bevelled off and forms with
a second pair of facets on the lateral portions a surface with
which the odontoid process of the second vertebra articulates.
The postero-lateral surfaces of the ventral arch also bear a pair of
little facets with which the cervical ribs articulate. The lateral
portions are somewhat flattened and expanded, and bear in addition
to those previously mentioned a pair of small downwardly
directed facets, the postzygapophyses, which articulate with the
prezygapophyses of the second vertebra. The dorsal portion
(fig. 41, 1) is somewhat triangular in shape, and overhangs the
occipital condyle. It is often regarded as the neural arch of a
vertebra in front of the atlas and is called the <i>pro-atlas</i>; but
as it is a membrane bone it is not properly a vertebral element.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The second or <b>axis vertebra</b> also differs a good deal from
the other cervicals. The centrum is massive, and is terminated
in front by a very large slightly concave articulating surface
formed by the <b>odontoid process</b> (fig. 41, 3) which is united
with the centrum by suture only, and is really the detached
centrum of the first vertebra. The cervical rib (fig. 41, 9)
articulates with two little irregularities on the odontoid process.
The posterior surface of the centrum is convex. The
neural arch is strongly developed and terminated dorsally
by a long neural spine (fig. 41, 5), its sides are notched,
slightly in front and more prominently behind for the exit of
the spinal nerves. It is drawn out in front into two little
processes bearing a pair of upwardly and outwardly directed
prezygapophyses, while the postzygapophyses are similar to
those of the other cervical vertebrae.</p>

<p>The last two cervical vertebrae resemble the succeeding
thoracic vertebrae, in the increased length of the transverse
processes, and the shifting dorsalwards of the facet with which
the capitulum of the rib articulates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Thoracic vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The thoracic vertebrae commence with the first of those
that bears ribs reaching the sternum. They are ten in
number, and the first eight are directly connected with the
sternum by ribs.</p>

<p>The <b>third</b> of them may be taken as a type. It has a
thick cylindrical centrum, concave in front and convex behind,
there is a slight hypapophysis, and the centrum is suturally
united with a strong neural arch enclosing a narrow neural
canal. The neural arch is drawn out dorsally into a wide
truncated neural spine, and laterally into two prominent
transverse processes, with the ends of which the tubercula of
the ribs articulate, while the capitulum articulates in each case
with a step-like facet (fig. 42, A, 3) on the anterior face of the
transverse process. The prezygapophyses (fig. 42, A, 2) are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
borne on outgrowths from the bases of the transverse processes,
and the postzygapophyses on outgrowths at the base of
the neural spine.</p>

<p>The thoracic vertebrae behind the third have no hypapophyses,
and the capitular facets gradually come to be placed
nearer and nearer the ends of the transverse processes, at the
same time becoming less prominent; otherwise these vertebrae
are just like the third.</p>

<p>In the first and second thoracic vertebrae the capitulum of
the rib articulates, not with a facet on the transverse process,
but with a little elevation borne at the line of junction of the
centrum and neural arch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lumbar vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>These are five in number, and are precisely like the
posterior thoracic vertebrae, except in the fact that the
transverse processes have no facets for the articulation of ribs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sacral vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>These are two in number, and while the centrum of the
first is concave in front (fig. 42, B, 6) and nearly flat behind,
that of the second is flat in front and concave behind. Each
has a pair of strong <b>ribs</b> (fig. 42, B, 4) firmly ankylosed in the
adult with a wide surface furnished partly by the centrum,
partly by the neural arch. The distal ends of these ribs are
united with the ilia. The character of the neural spines and
zygapophyses is the same as in the thoracic vertebrae.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Caudal vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>These are very numerous, about thirty-four in number.
The first differs from all the other vertebrae of the body in
having a biconvex centrum. The succeeding ones are procoelous
and are very much like the posterior thoracic and lumbar
vertebrae, having high neural spines and prominent straight
transverse processes. They differ however in having the
neural spines less strongly truncated above, and the transverse
processes arise from the centra and not from the neural
arches. When followed further back the centra and neural
spines gradually lengthen while the transverse processes become
reduced, and after the twelfth vertebra disappear.
Further back still the neural spines and zygapophyses
gradually become reduced and disappear, as finally the neural
arch does also, so that the last few vertebrae consist simply of
cylindrical centra.</p>

<p>Each caudal vertebra, except the first and the last eleven
or so, has a <b>V</b>-shaped <b>chevron bone</b> attached to the postero-ventral
edge of its centrum. The anterior ones are the largest
and they gradually decrease in size till they disappear.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Skull</span><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>The skull of the Crocodile is a massive depressed structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
presenting a number of striking characteristics, some of the
more important of which are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. All the bones except the mandible, hyoid, and columella
are firmly united by interlocking sutures. In spite of this,
however, growth of the whole skull and of the component
bones goes on continuously throughout life, this growth being
especially marked in the case of the facial as opposed to the
cranial part of the skull.</p>

<p>2. All the bones appearing on the dorsal surface are
remarkable for their curious roughened and pitted character;
this feature is prominent also in many Labyrinthodonts.</p>

<p>3. The size of the jaws and teeth is very great.</p>

<p>4. The mandibular condyle is carried back to some distance
behind the occipital condyle.</p>

<p>5. The occipital plane (see p. 386) of the skull is vertical.</p>

<p>6. The length of the secondary palate is remarkably great,
and the vomer takes no part in its formation.</p>

<p>7. The posterior nares are placed very far back, the nasal
passages being as in mammals separated from the mouth by
the long secondary palate.</p>

<p>8. There is a complicated system of Eustachian passages
communicating at one end with the tympanic cavity and at
the other end with the mouth cavity.</p>

<p>9. The interorbital septum is mainly cartilaginous, the
presphenoidal and orbitosphenoidal regions remaining unossified.</p>

<p>The <b>skull</b> is divisible into three parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the cranium, (2) the lower jaw, (3) the hyoid.</p>

<p>The <b>cranium</b> may again for purposes of description be
divided into:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. the cranium proper or brain case;</p>

<p>2. the bones connected with the several special sense
organs;</p>

<p>3. the bones of the upper jaw, and suspensorial apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The cartilage and membrane bones of the cranium proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
when taken together can in most vertebrates be seen to be
more or less arranged in three rings or segments called respectively
the <b>occipital</b>, <b>parietal</b> and <b>frontal</b> segments; in the
Crocodile however only the occipital and parietal segments
are clearly seen.</p>

<p>The <b>occipital segment</b> consists of four cartilage bones,
three of which together surround the <b>foramen magnum</b>.</p>

<p>The most ventral of these, the <b>basi-occipital</b> (figs. 43
and 45, 9), forms the single convex <b>occipital condyle</b> for
articulation with the atlas, bounds the base of the foramen
magnum, and is continuous laterally with two larger bones,
the <b>exoccipitals</b> (fig. 45, 24), which meet one another dorsally
and form the remainder of the boundary of the foramen
magnum. Each is drawn out externally into a strong process,
which is united below with the quadrate, and above with the
squamosal by a surface seen in a disarticulated skull to be
very rough and splintered. In a longitudinal section the
anterior face of the exoccipital is seen to be closely united
with the opisthotic.</p>

<p>The exoccipital is pierced by a number of foramina, four
lying on the posterior surface. Just external to the foramen
magnum is a small foramen for the exit of the hypoglossal
nerve (figs. 44 and 45, XII). External to this is the foramen
for the pneumogastric (fig. 44, X), while more ventrally still
is the foramen (fig. 44, 15) through which the internal carotid
artery enters the skull. Some distance further to the side,
and more dorsally, is a larger foramen which gives passage
to the facial nerve and certain blood-vessels.</p>

<p>In a median longitudinal section of the skull the hypoglossal
foramen is seen, and just in front of it a small foramen
for a vein. Further forwards the long slit-like opening
between the exoccipital and opisthotic is the <b>internal auditory
meatus</b> (fig. 45, VIII) through which the auditory
nerve leaves the cranial cavity and enters the internal
ear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>supra-occipital</b> (fig. 45, 5) is a small bone which
takes no part in the formation of the foramen magnum, and is
closely united in front with the epi-otic. It is characteristic of
Crocodiles that all the bones of the occipital segment have
their longer axes placed vertically, and that they scarcely if at
all appear on the dorsal surface.</p>

<p>In front of the occipital segment is the <b>parietal segment</b>.
The dorsal and ventral portions of the two segments are in
contact with one another, but the lateral portions are widely
separated by the interposition of the <b>auditory</b> and <b>suspensorial
bones</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>basisphenoid</b> (fig. 45, 12) is an unpaired wedge-shaped
bone, united along a deep vertical suture with the basi-occipital.
The two bones are, however, partially separated in
the mid-ventral line by a foramen, the opening of the <b>median
Eustachian canal</b>, which leads into a complicated system of
Eustachian passages ultimately communicating with the tympanic
cavity.</p>

<p>The dorsal surface of the basisphenoid is well seen in a
section of the skull, but owing to the way it tapers ventrally,
it appears on the ventral surface only as a very narrow strip
of bone wedged in between the basi-occipital and pterygoids.
In a lateral view it is seen to be drawn out in front into an
abruptly truncated process, the <b>rostrum</b>, which forms part of
the <b>interorbital septum.</b> On the anterior part of the dorsal
surface is a deep pit, the <b>pituitary fossa</b> or <b>sella turcica</b>,
at the base of which are a pair of foramina, through which
the carotid arteries pass. Dorsolaterally the basisphenoid
articulates with the <b>alisphenoids</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>alisphenoids</b> (fig. 45, 13) are a pair of irregular bones
which arise from the basisphenoid antero-laterally, and are
united dorsally with the parietal, frontal, and postfrontals.
They bound most of the anterior part of the brain case,
and each presents on its inner face a deep concavity which
lodges the cerebral hemisphere of its side. Viewed from
the ventral side the two alisphenoids are seen to almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
or quite meet one another immediately below the frontal,
and then to diverge, forming an irregular opening&mdash;partially
closed by cartilage in the fresh specimen,&mdash;through which
the optic nerves leave the cranial cavity. Further back the
alisphenoids meet one another for a narrow area, and then
diverge again, so that between each and the rostrum of
the basisphenoid there appears an opening (fig. 44, III, VI)
through which the oculomotor and abducens nerves leave
the cranium. Further back still each is united for a short
space with the basisphenoid, pterygoid and quadrate, and
then becomes separated from the quadrate by a large foramen,
the <b>foramen ovale</b> (fig. 44, V), through which the whole of
the trigeminal nerve passes out.</p>

<p>The dorsal portion of the parietal segment is formed by
the <i>parietal</i> (fig. 45, 4), which though double in the embryo,
early comes to form a single bone. It extends over the
posterior part of the cranial cavity, and is continuous in front
with the frontal, behind with the supra-occipital, and laterally
with the postfrontals, squamosals, alisphenoids, pro-otics and
epi-otics. It forms the inner boundary of a large rounded
vacuity on the roof of the skull, the <b>supratemporal fossa</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>frontal segment</b> is very imperfectly ossified, there
being no certain representatives of either the ventral member,
the presphenoid, or the lateral members, the orbitosphenoids.
On the dorsal side there is, however, a large development
of membrane bones. There is a large <i>frontal</i> (fig. 45, 3),
unpaired, except in the embryo, united behind with the
parietal and postfrontal, and drawn out in front into a long
process which is overlapped by the prefrontals and posterior
part of the nasals. The frontal ends off freely below, owing
to the orbitosphenoidal region being unossified, it forms a
considerable part of the roof of the cranial cavity, but takes
no part in the formation of the wall.</p>

<p>Each <i>prefrontal</i> (fig. 45, 14) forms part of the inner wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of the orbit and sends ventralwards a process which meets
the palatine.</p>

<p>The <i>postfrontals</i> (fig. 44, 6) are small bones lying at the
sides of the posterior part of the frontal. Each is united
with a number of bones, on its inner side with the frontal and
parietal, behind with the squamosal, and ventrally with the
alisphenoid. It also unites by means of a strong descending
process with an upgrowth from the jugal, and thus forms a
<b>postorbital bar</b> separating the orbit from the lateral temporal
fossa. The postfrontal forms also part of the outer
boundary of the supratemporal fossa.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Sense capsules.</span></p>

<p>Skeletal capsules occur in connection with each of the three
special sense organs of sight, of hearing and of smell.</p>

<p>The <b>Auditory capsules</b> and associated bones.</p>

<p>Three bones, the <b>epi-otic</b>, <b>opisthotic</b> and <b>pro-otic</b>,
together form the auditory or <b>periotic</b> capsule of each side.
They are wedged in between the lateral portions of the occipital
and parietal segments and complete the cranial wall in
this region. Their relations to the surrounding structures are
very complicated, and many points can be made out only in
sections of the skull passing right through the periotic capsule.
The relative position of the three bones is, however,
well seen in a median longitudinal section. The <b>opisthotic</b>
early becomes united with the exoccipital, while the <b>epi-otic</b>
similarly becomes united with the supra-occipital, the <b>pro-otic</b>
(fig. 45, 7),&mdash;seen in longitudinal section to be pierced
by the prominent <b>trigeminal foramen</b>&mdash;alone remaining
distinct throughout life. The three bones together surround
the essential organ of hearing which communicates laterally
with the deep tympanic cavity by the <b>fenestra ovalis</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>tympanic cavity</b>, leading to the exterior by the
<b>external auditory meatus</b> (fig. 44, 16), is well seen in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
side-view of the skull; it is bounded on its inner side by the
periotic bones, posteriorly in part by the exoccipital, and elsewhere
mainly by the quadrate. A large number of canals
and passages open into it. On its inner side opening ventro-anteriorly
is the <b>fenestra ovalis</b>, opening ventro-posteriorly
the <b>internal auditory meatus</b> (fig. 45, VIII), while dorsally
there is a wide opening which forms a communication through
the roof of the brain-case with the tympanic cavity of the
other side. On its posterior wall is the prominent foramen
through which the facial nerve passes on its way to its final
exit from the skull through the exoccipital, this foramen is
bounded by the quadrate, squamosal, and exoccipital.</p>

<p>The opening of the fenestra ovalis is in the fresh skull
occupied by the expanded end of the auditory ossicle, the
<b>columella</b>, whose outer end articulates by a concave facet
with a trifid <b>extra-columellar</b> cartilage which reaches the
tympanic membrane. The lower process of this extra-columella
passes into a cartilaginous rod which lies in a canal in the
quadrate and is during life continuous with Meckel's cartilage
within the articular bone of the mandible.</p>

<p>The columella and extra-columella are together homologous
with the chain of mammalian auditory ossicles.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The <b>Optic capsules</b> and associated bones.</p>

<p>Two pairs of bones are associated with the optic capsules,
viz. the <i>lachrymals</i> and the <i>supra-orbitals</i>. The <i>lachrymal</i>
(fig. 44, 3) is a fairly large flattened bone lying wedged in
between the maxillae, nasal, jugal, and prefrontal. It forms a
considerable part of the anterior boundary of the orbit, and is
pierced by two foramina. On the orbital edge is a large hole
leading into a cavity within the bone which lodges the naso-lachrymal
sac, and communicates with the narial passage by
a wide second foramen near the anterior end of the bone.
The <i>supra-orbital</i> is a very small loose bone lying in the eyelid
close to the junction of the frontal and prefrontal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The <b>Olfactory capsules</b> and associated bones.</p>

<p>Two pairs of membrane bones, the <i>vomers</i> and <i>nasals</i>, are
developed in association with the olfactory organ, but the
<b>mesethmoid</b> is not ossified.</p>

<p>The <i>vomers</i> form a pair of delicate bones, each consisting of
a vertical plate (fig. 45, 15), which with its fellow separates
the two narial passages, and of a horizontal plate which forms
much of their roof. The vomers articulate with one another
and with the pterygoids, palatines, and maxillae.</p>

<p>The <i>nasals</i> (fig. 45, 2) are very long narrow bones extending
along the middle line from the frontal almost to the
anterior nares. They are continuous laterally with the premaxillae,
maxillae, lachrymals and prefrontals. They form
the roof of the narial passages.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Upper Jaw and suspensorial apparatus.</span></p>

<p>These are enormously developed in the Crocodile and are
firmly united to the cranium. It will be most convenient to
begin by describing the bones at the anterior end of the jaw
and to work back thence towards the brain-case. The most
anterior bones are the <i>premaxillae</i>. The <i>premaxillae</i> (figs. 44
and 45, 1) are small bones, each bearing five pairs of teeth,
set in separate sockets in their alveolar borders. They constitute
almost the whole of the boundary of the <b>anterior
nares</b>, which are confluent with one another and form a
large semicircular opening in the roof of the skull, leading
into the wide narial passage. They are also partially separated
from one another in the ventral middle line, by the
small <b>anterior palatine vacuity</b> (fig. 43, A, 8). They form
the anterior part of the broad <b>palate</b>. The alveolar border
on each side between certain of the teeth is marked by pits
which receive the points of the teeth of the other jaw. The
first pair of these pits in the premaxillae are often so deep as
to be converted into perforations. Pits of the same character
occur between the maxillary and mandibular teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>maxillae</i> (figs. 43, A, 2 and 44, 2) are a pair of very
large bones and bear the remaining teeth of the upper jaw,
set in sockets along their alveolar borders. On the dorsal
side each maxillae is continuous with the premaxillae, nasal,
lachrymal, and jugal, while ventrally it meets its fellow in a
long straight suture and forms the greater part of the long
bony palate. The maxillae are separated in the middle line
posteriorly by processes from the palatines, while further back
they meet the transpalatines. The internal or nasal surface,
like that of the premaxillae, is excavated by a deep longitudinal
groove, the <b>narial passage</b>. In a ventral view of the
skull a number of small openings (fig. 43, A, 21) are seen
close to the alveolar border, these are the openings of small
vascular canals which lead into the <b>alveolar sinus</b>, a passage
traversing the maxillae, and transmitting the superior maxillary
branch of the trigeminal nerve and certain blood-vessels.
This alveolar sinus opens posteriorly by the more external of
the two large holes in the maxillae, which lie close to the
anterior edge of the posterior palatine vacuity, to be described
immediately. The more internal of these holes, on the other
hand, leads into a cavity lodging the nasal sac. Behind the
maxillae the completeness of the palate is broken up by the
large oval <b>posterior palatine vacuities</b> (fig. 43, A, 7);
these are separated from one another in the middle line by the
palatines, and are bounded elsewhere by the maxillae, transpalatines,
and pterygoids.</p>

<p>The <i>palatines</i> (fig. 43, A, 3) are long and rather narrow
bones interposed between the maxillae in front and pterygoids
behind. They meet one another in a long suture and form
much of the posterior part of the palate, while the whole length
of their dorsal surface contributes to the floor of the narial
passage. The dorsal surface of each bone is also drawn out
on its outer side into a prominent ridge which forms much of
the side and roof of the narial passage, being in contact with
the vomer and pterygoid, and at one point by means of a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ascending process with the descending process of the prefrontal.</p>

<p>The <i>pterygoids</i> (figs. 43, A, 4, and 45, 11) are a pair of
large bones, each consisting of a median more or less vertical
part, which becomes ankylosed to its fellow in the middle
line early in life, and of a wide horizontal part which meets
the transpalatine. They completely surround the posterior
nares (fig. 43, A, 5) and their median portions form the whole
boundary of the posterior part of the narial passage, and assist
the palatines and vomers in bounding the middle part. The
horizontal parts form the posterior part of the secondary palate,
while the dorsal surface of each looks into the <b>pterygoid fossa</b>,
a large cavity lying below the quadrate and quadratojugal at
the side of the skull. The lateral margin adjoining the transpalatine
is in the fresh skull terminated by a plate of cartilage
against which the mandible plays. Dorsally the pterygoid
articulates with the basisphenoid, quadrate, and alisphenoid.</p>

<p>The <i>transpalatines</i> (fig. 44, 11) connect the pterygoids with
the jugals and maxillae, articulating with each of the three
bones by a long pointed process. The jugal process meets also
a down-growth from the postfrontal.</p>

<p>The <i>jugals</i> or <i>malars</i> (fig. 44, 5) are long somewhat flattened
bones which are united to the lachrymals and maxillae
in front, while passing backwards each is united behind to the
<i>quadratojugal</i> (fig. 44, 12), the two forming the <b>infratemporal
arcade</b> which constitutes the external boundary of the orbit
and lateral temporal fossa. The jugal is united below to the
transpalatine, and the two bones together form an outgrowth,
which meeting that from the postfrontal forms the <b>postorbital
bar</b>, and separates the orbit from the lateral temporal fossa.
The quadratojugals are small bones and are united behind
with the quadrates.</p>

<p>The <b>quadrate</b> (figs. 43, A, 13 and 44, 8) of each side is
a large somewhat flattened bone firmly fixed in among the
other bones of the skull. It is terminated posteriorly by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
elongated slightly convex surface, coated with cartilage in the
fresh skull, by which the mandible articulates with the cranium.
The dorsal surface of the quadrate is flat behind, further forwards
it becomes much roughened and articulates with the
exoccipital and squamosal; further forwards still it becomes
marked by a deep groove which forms the floor of the external
auditory meatus and part of the tympanic cavity.
The anterior boundary of the quadrate is extremely irregular,
it is united dorsally with the postfrontal, pro-otic, and
squamosal, and more ventrally with the alisphenoid. The
smooth ventral surface looks into the pterygoid fossa. In
front the quadrate forms the posterior boundary of the supratemporal
fossa and foramen ovale, and is continuous with the
alisphenoid, while it sends down a thin plate meeting the
pterygoid and basisphenoid. On the inner side of the dorsal
surface of the quadrate near the condyle, is a small foramen
which leads into a tube communicating with the tympanic
cavity, by a foramen lying in front of and ventral to that for
the exit of the facial nerve. By this tube air can pass from
the tympanic cavity into the articular bone of the mandible.</p>

<p>The <i>squamosal</i> (fig. 44, 7) meets the quadrate and exoccipital
below, and forms part of the roof of the external auditory
meatus, while above it forms part of the roof of the skull and
has a pitted structure like that of the other bones of the roof.
It is continuous with the postfrontal in front, forming with
it the <b>supratemporal arcade</b> which constitutes the outer
boundary of the supratemporal fossa. It meets also the
parietal on its inner side, forming the <b>post-temporal bar</b>, the
posterior boundary of the supratemporal fossa.</p>

<p>It may be useful to recapitulate the large vacuities in the
surface of the Crocodile's cranium.</p>

<p><i>Dorsal surface.</i></p>

<p>1. <b>The Supratemporal fossae</b>. Each is bounded internally
by the parietal, behind by the <b>post-temporal bar</b>
formed by the parietal and squamosal, and externally by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<b>supratemporal arcade</b> formed by the squamosal and postfrontal.
The postfrontal meets the parietal in front and forms
the anterior boundary of the supratemporal fossa.</p>

<p>2. The <b>Lateral temporal</b> or <b>infratemporal fossae</b>.
These lie below and to the outer side of the supratemporal
fossae. Each is bounded dorso-internally by the supratemporal
arcade; and behind by a continuation of the post-temporal bar
formed by the quadrate and quadratojugal. The external
boundary is the <b>infratemporal arcade</b> formed of the quadratojugal
and jugal, while in front the fossa is separated from
the orbit by the <b>postorbital bar</b> formed by the junction of
outgrowths from the postfrontal and jugal.</p>

<p>3. The <b>Orbits</b>. Each is bounded behind by the postorbital
bar, externally by the jugal forming a continuation of
the infratemporal arcade, in front by the lachrymal, and internally
by the frontal and prefrontal.</p>

<p>4. The <b>Anterior nares</b>. These form an unpaired opening
bounded by the premaxillae.</p>

<p><i>Posterior surface.</i></p>

<p>5. The <b>Foramen magnum</b>. The exoccipitals form the
chief part of its boundary, but part of the ventral boundary
is formed by the basi-occipital.</p>

<p>6. The <b>Pterygoid fossae</b>. These form a pair of large
cavities at the sides of the occipital region of the skull. The
dorsal boundary is formed by the quadrate and quadratojugal,
the ventral by the pterygoid, the internal chiefly by the quadrate,
pterygoid, alisphenoid, and basisphenoid. The transpalatine
forms a small part of the external boundary which is incomplete.</p>

<p><i>Ventral surface.</i></p>

<p>7. The <b>Posterior nares</b>. These form a median unpaired
opening (fig. 43, A, 5) bounded by the pterygoids.</p>

<p>8. The <b>Posterior palatine vacuities</b>. Each is
bounded by the maxillae in front, the maxillae and transpalatine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
externally, the transpalatine and pterygoid behind, and the
palatine on the inner side (fig. 43, A, 7).</p>

<p>9. The <b>Anterior palatine vacuity</b>. This is unpaired
and is bounded by the premaxillae (fig. 43, A, 8).</p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">The Lower Jaw or Mandible.</span></p>

<p>The mandible is a strong compact bony structure formed
of two halves or <b>rami</b>, which are suturally united at the
symphysis in the middle line in front. Each ramus is formed
of six separate bones.</p>

<p>The most anterior and largest of these is the <i>dentary</i> (figs.
44, 20, and 45, 18), which forms the symphysis, and greater part
of the anterior half of the jaw, and bears along the outer part
of its dorsal border a number of sockets or <b>alveoli</b> in which
the teeth are placed. Lying along the inner side of the dentary
is a large splint-like bone, the <i>splenial</i> (fig. 45, 19), which does
not extend so far forwards as the symphysis, and is separated
from the dentary posteriorly by a large cavity. Forming the
lower part of all the posterior half of the jaw is the large
<i>angular</i> (figs. 44, 22, and 45, 20), which underlies the posterior
part of the dentary in front and sends a long process below that
bone to the splenial. On the inner side of the jaw there is an
oval vacuity, the <b>internal mandibular foramen</b> (fig. 45, 28),
between the angular and the splenial; through this pass blood-vessels
and branches of the inferior dental nerve. Lying
dorsal to the angular is another large bone, the <i>supra-angular</i>
(figs. 44, 18, and 45, 21). It extends back as far as the posterior
end of the jaw and forwards for some distance dorsal
to the dentary and splenial. It forms part of the posterior
margin of a large vacuity, the <b>external mandibular foramen</b>,
which is bordered above and in front by the dentary and below
by the angular; it gives passage to the cutaneous branch of
the inferior dental nerve. The concave surface for articulation
with the mandible and much of the posterior end of the jaw is
formed by a short but solid bone, the <b>articular</b> (fig. 45, 22),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
which in young skulls rather readily becomes detached. The
remaining mandibular bone is the <i>coronoid</i> (fig. 45, 23), a very
small bone of irregular shape attached to the angular below,
and to the supra-angular and splenial above.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">The Hyoid.</span></p>

<p>The hyoid of the Crocodile consists of a wide flattened
plate of cartilage, the <b>basilingual plate</b> or <b>body of the
hyoid</b>, and a pair of <b>cornua</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>basilingual plate</b> (fig. 53, 1) is rounded anteriorly
and marked by a deep notch posteriorly. The <b>cornua</b> (fig.
53, 3), which are attached at a pair of notches near the middle
of the outer border of the basilingual plate, are partly ossified,
but their expanded ends are formed of cartilage. They pass
at first backwards and then upwards and inwards. They
are homologous with part of the first branchial arches of
Selachians.</p>

<p>The columella and extra-columella have been already described
(p. 251).</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Ribs and Sternum.</span></p>

<p><b>Thoracic ribs.</b></p>

<p>The Crocodile has ten pairs of <b>thoracic ribs</b>, all except
the last one or two of which consist of three parts,&mdash;a vertebral
rib, an intermediate rib and a sternal rib.</p>

<p>Of the <b>vertebral ribs</b> the third may be taken as a type,
it consists of a curved bony rod which articulates proximally
with the transverse process of the vertebra by two facets.
The terminal one of these, the <b>capitulum</b> or <b>head</b>, articulates
with a notch on the side of the transverse process; the other,
the <b>tuberculum</b>, which lies on the dorsal surface a short
distance behind the head, articulates with the end of the transverse
process. From near the distal end an imperfectly ossified
uncinate <b>process</b> (see p. 190) projects backwards.</p>

<p>The <b>intermediate ribs</b> are short and imperfectly ossified;
they are united with the <b>sternal ribs</b> (fig. 46, 3), which are large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
flattened, likewise imperfectly ossified structures, and articulate
at their distal ends with a pair of long divergent <b>xiphisternal
horns</b> (fig. 46, 5), which arise from the posterior end
of the sternum proper. The last pair of sternal ribs are attached
to the preceding pair, not to the xiphisternal horns.</p>

<p>The first and second vertebral ribs differ from the others in
the fact that the tuberculum forms a fairly long outstanding
process.</p>


<p><b>Cervical ribs.</b></p>

<p>Movable ribs are attached to all the cervical as well as to the
thoracic vertebrae. Those borne by the atlas and axis are long,
narrow structures attached by a fairly broad base, and tapering
gradually. The ribs borne by the third to seventh cervical
vertebrae are shaped like a <b>T</b> with a double base, one limb of
which, corresponding to the tuberculum (fig. 41, 7), articulates
with a short transverse process arising from the neural arch,
while the other, corresponding to the capitulum, articulates with
a surface on the centrum. The ribs attached to the eighth and
ninth cervical vertebrae are intermediate in character between
the <b>T</b>-shaped ribs and the ordinary thoracic ribs. The anterior
limb of the <b>T</b> is shortened, the posterior one is drawn out,
forming the shaft of the rib. The distal portion of the rib of
the ninth cervical vertebra is unossified.</p>

<p>The <b>Sacral ribs</b> have been described in connection with
the sacral vertebrae.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sternum.</span></p>

<p>The <b>sternum</b> of Crocodiles is a very simple structure, consisting
of a plate of cartilage (fig. 46, 2) lying immediately
dorsal to the interclavicle, and drawn out posteriorly into a
pair of long <b>xiphisternal horns</b> (fig. 46, 5).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Lying superficially to the recti muscles of the ventral body-wall,
behind the sternal ribs, are seven or eight series of
slender curved bones, the <i>abdominal ribs</i> (fig. 46, 4). Each
series consists of four or more bones, arranged in a <b>V</b>-like
form with the angle of the <b>V</b> directed forwards. They show a
considerable amount of variability in number and character.
They are really membrane bones, and are in no way homologous
with true ribs, but correspond rather with the more

<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pectoral girdle of the Crocodile is less complete than is
that of most reptiles. It consists of a dorsal bone, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<b>scapula</b>, and a ventral bone, the <b>coracoid</b>, with a median
unpaired element, the <i>interclavicle</i>; but there is no separate
representative either of the clavicle or precoracoid.</p>

<p>The <b>scapula</b> (fig. 47, 1) is a large bone, flattened and expanded
above where it is terminated by an unossified margin,
the <b>suprascapula</b>, and thickened below where it meets the
coracoid. The scapula forms about half the <b>glenoid cavity</b>
(fig. 47, 4) for articulation with the humerus, and has the
lower part of its anterior border drawn out into a roughened
ridge.</p>

<p>The <b>coracoid</b> (fig. 47, 2) is a flattened bone, much expanded
at either end; it bears on its upper posterior border a
flattened surface which forms half the glenoid cavity, and is
firmly united to the scapula at its dorsal end. Its ventral end
meets the sternum.</p>

<p>The <i>interclavicle</i> (figs. 46, 1, and 47, 3) is a long narrow
blade-shaped bone lying along the ventral side of the sternum;
about a third of its length projects beyond the sternum in
front.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Anterior limb.</span></p>

<p>This is as usual divisible into three portions, the upper
arm, fore-arm and manus.</p>

<p>The <b>upper arm</b> or <b>brachium</b> contains one bone, the
<b>humerus.</b></p>

<p>The <b>humerus</b> (fig. 48, A, 1) is a fairly long stout bone,
considerably expanded at either end. The proximal end or head
is evenly rounded and is formed by an epiphysis ossifying from
a centre different from that forming the shaft. It articulates
with the glenoid cavity. The shaft bears on the flexor surface,
at some little distance behind the head, a prominent rounded
protuberance, the <b>deltoid ridge.</b> The distal end or trochlea
is also formed by an epiphysis and is partially divided by a
groove into two convex surfaces; it articulates with the two
bones of the fore-arm, the radius and ulna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b> are nearly equal in size and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
consists of a long shaft terminated at either end by an epiphysis.</p>

<p>The <b>radius</b> (fig. 48, A, 2) or pre-axial bone is slightly the
smaller of the two. It has a straight cylindrical shaft and is
slightly and nearly evenly expanded at either end. The proximal
end which articulates with the humerus is flat or slightly
concave, the distal end which articulates with the carpus is
slightly convex.</p>

<p>The <b>ulna</b> (fig. 48, A, 3) or postaxial bone is a curved bone
rather larger than the radius. Its proximal end is large and
convex, but is not drawn out into an olecranon process.</p>

<p>The <b>Manus</b> consists of the <b>carpus</b> or <b>wrist</b>, and the
<b>hand</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Carpus</b>. This differs considerably from the more
primitive type met with in the Turtle. It consists of six
elements arranged in a proximal row of three and a distal row
of two, with one intervening. The bones of the proximal row
are the radiale, the ulnare, and the pisiform. The <b>radiale</b>
(fig. 48, A, 4) is the largest bone of the carpus: it is a somewhat
hour-glass shaped bone, with its ends formed by flattened
epiphyses. It articulates by its proximal end with the whole
of the radius, and partly also with the ulna, and by its
distal end with the centrale.</p>

<p>The <b>ulnare</b> (fig. 48, A, 5) is a smaller bone, also somewhat
hour-glass shaped; it articulates proximally with the
pisiform and radiale, not quite reaching the ulna. The third
bone of the proximal row is the <b>pisiform</b> (fig. 48, A, 6), an
irregular bone, articulating with the ulna, radiale, and fifth
metacarpal. The <b>centrale</b> is a flattened cartilaginous element
applied to the distal surface of the radiale.</p>

<p>The distal row of carpals consists of two small structures.
The first of these forms a small cartilaginous patch, which is
wedged in between the first and second metacarpals, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
centrale and the bone representing carpalia 3, 4 and 5; this
cartilaginous patch represents <b>carpalia 1 and 2</b> (fig. 48, A, 7).
The bone representing <b>carpalia 3, 4 and 5</b> is a good deal
larger, rounded, and well-ossified; it articulates with the
ulnare, the pisiform, and the third, fourth, and fifth metacarpals.</p>

<p>The <b>hand</b>. Each of the five digits consists of an elongated
metacarpal, terminated at each end by an epiphysis, and of a
varying number of phalanges. The terminal phalanx of each
digit has an epiphysis only at its proximal end, the others have
them at both ends.</p>

<p>The first digit, or <b>pollex</b>, is the stoutest, and has two
phalanges, the second has three, the third four, the fourth
three, and the fifth two. The terminal phalanx of each of the
first three digits is pointed and sheathed in a horny claw; and
is also marked by a pair of prominent lateral grooves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic girdle of the Crocodile consists of four parts, a
dorsal element, the <b>ilium</b>, an anterior ventral element, the
<b>pubis</b>, a posterior ventral element, the <b>ischium</b>, and an
accessory anterior ventral element, the <b>epipubis</b>. All except
the epipubis take part in the formation of the <b>acetabulum</b>,
which is perforated by a prominent hole.</p>

<p>The <b>ilium</b> (fig. 49, 1) is a thick strong bone, firmly united
on its inner side with the two sacral ribs. Its dorsal border
is rounded, its ventral border bears posteriorly two irregular
surfaces, completed by epiphyses, which are united respectively
with the ischium and pubis.</p>

<p>The <b>ischium</b> (fig. 49, 2)&mdash;the largest bone of the pelvis,
is somewhat contracted in the middle and expanded at either
end. Its proximal end, which is formed by an epiphysis,
bears two surfaces, one of which is united to the ilium,
while the other forms part of the acetabulum. The anterior
border is also drawn out dorsally into a strong process, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
is terminated by a convex epiphysis, and is united to the
pubis. The ventral end of the ischium forms a flattened blade,
meeting its fellow in a median symphysis.</p>

<p>The <b>pubis</b> (fig. 49, 3) is much smaller than either the ilium
or ischium; it forms a small patch of unossified cartilage, interposed
between the anterior parts of the ilium and ischium.</p>

<p>The <b>epipubis</b> (fig. 49, 4) is a large bone with a thickened
proximal end, which is loosely articulated to the ischium, and
a flattened expanded distal end, which is united with its fellow,
and with the last pair of abdominal ribs by a large plate of
cartilage. This bone is generally described as the pubis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Posterior limb.</span></p>

<p>This is as usual divisible into three portions, the <b>thigh</b>,
the <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b>, and the <b>pes</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>thigh</b> is formed by the <b>femur</b> (fig. 48, B, 12), a
moderately long stout bone, not unlike the humerus; it articulates
with the acetabulum by a fairly prominent rounded
<b>head</b>. The distal end articulating with the tibia and fibula
is also expanded, and is partially divided into equal parts by
anterior and posterior grooves. The flexor surface bears a
fairly prominent trochanteric ridge. Each end of the femur
is formed by an epiphysis.</p>

<p>The <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b> includes two bones, the <b>tibia</b> and
<b>fibula</b>. Both are well developed, but the tibia is considerably
the larger of the two.</p>

<p>The <b>tibia</b> (fig. 48, B, 13) is a strong bone with a flattened
expanded proximal end articulating with almost the whole of
the end of the femur, and a similarly expanded distal end
articulating with a bone representing the fused astragalus and
centrale.</p>

<p>The <b>fibula</b> (fig. 48, B, 14) is flattened proximally, and
articulates with only quite a small part of the femur, while
distally it is more expanded, and articulates with the fibulare
(calcaneum) and with a facet on the side of the fused astragalus
and centrale.</p>

<p>The <b>Pes</b> consists of the <b>tarsus</b> or <b>ankle</b>, and the <b>foot</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Tarsus</b>. This, like the carpus, is much reduced and
modified from the primitive condition. It consists of only
four bones, arranged in two rows of two each. The two
bones of the proximal row are much larger than are those of
the distal row. The pre-axial of them (fig. 48, B, 15) representing
the fused <b>astragalus</b> (tibiale and intermedium) and
<b>centrale</b>, articulates proximally with the tibia and fibula, and
distally with the first metatarsal, and a small bone representing
the first three tarsalia. The postaxial bone, the <b>calcaneum</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
(fibulare) (fig. 48, B, 16), is drawn out into a prominent posterior
process forming a heel such as is almost unknown elsewhere
except in mammals. It articulates with the fibula, the tibiale-centrale,
and distally with a bone representing the fourth and
fifth tarsalia, and with the fifth metatarsal.</p>

<p>The two bones forming the distal row of tarsals are both
small and rounded; one represents the first three tarsalia fused
together, the other tarsalia 4 and 5.</p>

<p>The <b>Foot</b>. The <b>foot</b> has five digits, but the fifth is much
reduced, consisting only of a short metatarsal. The first four
<b>metatarsals</b> are all long bones, slightly expanded at each
end, and terminated by small epiphyses. The first digit has
two phalanges, the second three, the third four, and the fourth
five. The terminal or <b>ungual phalanx</b> in each instance is
grooved and pointed, and in the case of the first three digits
bears a horny claw. The ungual phalanx progressively decreases
in size from the first to the fourth. The fifth digit
consists only of a small, somewhat square metatarsal (fig. 48,
B, 21), attached to the bone representing the fused fourth and
fifth tarsalia.</p>

<small>GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN REPTILES.</small></h2>


<p>EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton both epidermal and dermal is exceedingly
well developed in reptiles.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Epidermal Exoskeleton.</span></p>

<p>This generally has the form of overlapping horny <b>scales</b>
which invest outgrowths of the dermis, and are found covering
the whole body in most Rhynchocephalia, Ophidia, and Lacertilia,
and many Crocodilia. In the Ophidia the ventral surface
of the tail is commonly covered by a double row of broad scales,
while the ventral surface of the precaudal part of the body is
covered by a single row. In the burrowing snakes (Typhlopidae)
and some sea snakes (Hydrophidae) these broad scales
do not occur, the scales of the ventral surface being similar to
those of the dorsal.</p>

<p>In the Chelonia with the exception of <i>Dermochelys</i>, <i>Trionyx</i>
and their allies there is a well-developed system of horny shields
having a regular arrangement which has been described in the
account of the Turtle's skeleton<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>rattle of the rattlesnake</b> is an epidermal structure
formed of several loosely articulated horny rings, produced by
the modification of the epidermal covering of the end of the
tail, which instead of being cast off when the rest of the outer
skin is shed is retained loosely interlocked with the adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
ring or joint. New rings are thus periodically added to the
base of the rattle, and in old animals the terminal ones wear
away and are lost.</p>

<p>Horny claws occur on the ends of some or all of the digits
in most living reptiles.</p>

<p>Owen's Chameleon bears three epidermal horns, one arising
from the nasal and two from the frontal region.</p>

<p>In the Chelonia, some of the Theromorpha such as <i>Udenodon</i>
and <i>Dicynodon</i>, probably also in the Pterosauria and
<i>Polyonax</i> among the Dinosaurs, the jaws are more or less
cased in horny beaks. The horny beaks of Chelonia are
variable; sometimes they have cutting edges, sometimes they
are denticulated, sometimes they are adapted for crushing.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dermal Exoskeleton.</span></p>

<p>Nearly all Crocodilia, many Dinosauria, some Rhynchocephalia
and Pythonomorpha, and some Lacertilia such as <i>Tiliqua</i>,
<i>Scincus</i> and <i>Anguis</i> have a dermal exoskeleton of bony scutes,
developed below and corresponding in shape to the epidermal
scales. Sometimes as in <i>Caiman sclerops</i>, <i>Jacare</i> and <i>Teleosaurus</i>,
the scutes completely invest the body, being so
arranged as to form a dorsal and a ventral shield, and a continuous
series of rings round the tail. In <i>Crocodilus</i> they are
confined to the dorsal surface, and in <i>Alligator</i> to the dorsal
and ventral surfaces. The scutes of some extinct forms articulate
with one another by a peg and socket arrangement as in
some Ganoid fish.</p>

<p>The <b>carapace</b> of most Chelonia is a compound structure,
being partly endoskeletal and formed from the ribs and vertebrae,
partly from plates derived from the dermal exoskeleton.
The common arrangement is seen in fig. 36. All the surface
plates are probably exoskeletal in origin, but united with the
ventral surfaces of the costal and neural plates respectively are
the expanded ribs and neural arches of the vertebrae.</p>

<p>The <b>plastron</b> in the common genus <i>Chelone</i> (fig. 37)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
includes nine plates of bone, one unpaired and four pairs;
they will be referred to in connection with the ribs and pectoral
girdle.</p>

<p>In the Leathery Turtle (<i>Dermochelys</i>) the carapace and
plastron differ completely from those of any other living
form. The carapace consists of a number of polygonal ossifications
fitting closely together and altogether distinct from the
vertebrae and ribs. The plastron is imperfectly ossified, and
not united with the pelvis, and the whole surface of both
carapace and plastron is covered with a tough leathery skin,
without horny shields.</p>

<p>Some of the extinct Dinosauria have an enormously developed
dermal exoskeleton. Thus in <i>Stegosaurus</i> and <i>Omosaurus</i>
the dorsal surface is provided with flattened plates or
with spines reaching a length of upwards of two feet. In
<i>Polacanthus</i> the posterior part of the body is protected by a
bony shield somewhat recalling that of the little armadillo
<i>Chlamydophorus</i>. No exoskeleton is known in Ichthyosauria,
Sauropterygia, Pterosauria, many Dinosauria and Theromorpha,
and some Lacertilia, such as <i>Chamaeleon</i> and <i>Amphisbaena</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Teeth.</span></p>

<p>The teeth of reptiles are generally well developed, and in
the great majority of forms are simple conical structures,
uniform in character, generally somewhat recurved, and often
with serrated edges. Another common type of tooth is that
with a laterally compressed triangular crown provided with
a double cutting edge which may or may not be serrated. The
teeth are mainly formed of dentine, with usually an external
layer of enamel, and often a coating of cement on the root.
Vasodentine is found below the dentine in <i>Iguanodon</i>. The
teeth of reptiles never have the enamel deeply infolded, nor
do they have double roots.</p>

<p>Teeth may be present not only on the jaw-bones, but as in
many <i>Squamata</i>, also on the palatines, pterygoids or vomers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
The method by which they are attached to the bones varies
much. Sometimes as in <i>Iguana</i> and some other lizards, they
are pleurodont[1], sometimes they are acrodont<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, as in the Rhynchocephalia,
Pythonomorpha, Ophidia and some Lacertilia such
as <i>Agama</i>. Again they may be set in a continuous groove
as in the Ichthyosauria and young Crocodilia. Finally the
teeth may be <i>thecodont</i> or placed in distinct sockets as in the
Theromorpha, Sauropterygia, adult Crocodilia, Sauropoda and
Theropoda. In <i>Iguanodon</i> the teeth are set in shallow sockets
in a groove one side of which is higher than the other; the
method of attachment thus shows points of resemblance to
the thecodont condition, the pleurodont condition, and that
met with in the Ichthyosauria.</p>

<p>In <i>Ichthyosaurus</i> the teeth are marked by a number of
vertical furrows, and it is from a furrow of this nature greatly
enlarged and converted into a tube that the channel down
which flows the poison of venomous snakes is derived.</p>

<p>In most reptiles the dentition is more or less homodont.
The only reptiles in which a definite heterodont dentition is
known are the extinct Theromorpha, and in them the teeth
vary greatly. Thus <i>Udenodon</i> is toothless, the jaws having
been probably cased in a horny beak. In <i>Dicynodon</i> the jaws
are likewise toothless with the exception of a pair of permanently
growing tusks borne by the maxillae. <i>Dicynodon</i> is the
only known reptile whose teeth have permanently growing
pulps. In <i>Pariasaurus</i> the teeth are uniform and very numerous,
and though placed in distinct sockets are ankylosed to
the jaw. In <i>Galesaurus</i> and <i>Cynognathus</i> three kinds of teeth
can be distinguished, slender conical incisor-like teeth, large
canine-like teeth, and cheek teeth with two or three cusps.
The teeth in <i>Galesaurus</i> are confined to the jaws, in <i>Placodus</i>
and its allies, however, large flat crushing teeth are attached to
the palatines as well as to the jaw-bones, and in <i>Pariasaurus</i>
the vomer, palatine and pterygoid all bear teeth as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
jaw bones. The upper jaw of <i>Sphenodon</i> and other Rhynchocephalia
is provided with two parallel rows of teeth, one
borne on the maxillae and one on the palatines, the mandibular
teeth bite in a groove between these two rows. The
bone of the jaws in <i>Sphenodon</i> is so hard that when the teeth
get worn away, it can act as a substitute. In the young
<i>Sphenodon</i> the vomers bear teeth, as they do also in <i>Proterosaurus</i>.</p>

<p>There is generally a continuous succession of teeth throughout
life, the new tooth coming up below, or partly at the side
of the one in use, and causing the absorption of part of its
wall or base. In this way the new tooth comes to lie in the
pulp cavity of the old one. This method of succession is well
seen in the Crocodilia.</p>

<p>Teeth have been detected in embryos of <i>Trionyx</i>, but
otherwise no teeth are known to occur in Chelonia, or in
<i>Pteranodon</i> (Pterosauria), while the anterior part of the jaw
is edentulous in <i>Iguanodon</i>, <i>Polyonax</i> and some other Dinosaurs,
and in <i>Rhamphorhynchus</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>


<p>ENDOSKELETON.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vertebral column.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral column is commonly divisible into the usual
five regions, but in the Ophidia, Ichthyosauria, and Amphisbaenidae
among Lacertilia, only into caudal and precaudal
regions. In the Chelonia there are no lumbar vertebrae.</p>

<p>The form of the vertebral centra is very variable. A large
proportion of extinct reptiles,&mdash;several entire orders,&mdash;and the
earlier and more primitive forms in some of the other groups
have amphicoelous vertebrae. Vertebrae of this type occur
in the Theromorpha, Ichthyosauria, most Sauropterygia and
Rhynchocephalia, and many Dinosauria, also in some of the
early Crocodilia such as <i>Belodon</i>, <i>Teleosaurus</i> and <i>Goniopholis</i>,
and the Geckonidae among Lacertilia.</p>

<p>The majority of living reptiles have procoelous vertebrae.
Thus they occur in the Lacertilia (excluding the Geckos), the
Ophidia, and the Crocodilia, also among extinct forms in the
Pterosauria and many Dinosauria. On the other hand some
Dinosauria such as <i>Iguanodon</i> have opisthocoelous cervical
vertebrae, while others have opisthocoelous thoracic vertebrae.
The vertebrae of the Ceratopsidae and some Sauropterygia,
the thoracic vertebrae of <i>Iguanodon</i>, and the sacral vertebrae
of Crocodilia have flat centra. The first caudal vertebra of
modern Crocodilia is biconvex, and in the Chelonia all types
of vertebral centra are found. The cervical vertebrae of
<i>Sphenodon</i> are noticeable for the occurrence of a small pro-atlas,
which may represent the neural arch of a vertebra in
front of the atlas.</p>

<p>In most reptiles the vertebrae are fully ossified, but in
some of the more primitive forms the notochord persists in
the centre of the vertebra (i.e. intervertebrally), this is the
case for instance in many of the Theromorpha and Rhynchocephalia,
and also in the Geckos. In other reptiles it persists
longest intravertebrally.</p>

<p>The centrum of each of the caudal vertebrae of most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Lacertilia is traversed by an unossified septum along which it
readily breaks.</p>

<p>Chevron bones occur below the caudal vertebrae in Lacertilia,
Chelonia, Ichthyosauria, many Dinosauria, and <i>Sphenodon</i>,
articulating with quite the posterior part of the centrum which
bears them. In Lacertilia and Crocodilia (fig. 41, 3) the axis
has a well-marked odontoid process. The ventral portions of
the intervertebral discs are sometimes ossified, forming wedge-shaped
inter centra, as in Geckos, and the cervical vertebrae of
<i>Sphenodon</i>.</p>

<p>In snakes, Theropod Dinosaurs, and the iguanas among
lizards, the neural arches are provided with <i>zygosphenes</i>, and
<i>zygantra</i>.</p>

<p>The neural arches are usually firmly ankylosed to the
centra, but in the Crocodilia and some Chelonia, Sauropterygia,
and Dinosauria, the suture between the centrum and neural
arch persists at any rate till late in life. In the Ichthyosauria
the neural arches were united to the centra by cartilage only.</p>

<p>The thoracic vertebrae of some of the Theromorpha (<i>Dimetrodon</i>)
are remarkable for the extraordinary development of
the neural spine, and those of Chelonia for the absence of
transverse processes.</p>

<p>In living reptiles the number of sacral vertebrae is nearly
always two, but in the Theromorpha, Dinosauria, and Pterosauria,
as many as five or six bones may be ankylosed together
in the sacral region. In Crocodiles the two halves of the pelvis
sometimes articulate with different vertebrae. The vertebrae
of some of the great Sauropoda are remarkably hollowed out,
having a large vacuity on each side of the centrum communicating
with a series of internal cavities. The whole structure
of these vertebrae shows a combination of great strength with
lightness.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Skull</span>.</p>

<p>The reptilian skull is well ossified and the bones are noticeable
for their density. The true cranium is often largely concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
by a secondary or false roof of membrane bones, which is best
seen in the Ichthyosauria and some of the Chelonia. In other
reptiles the false roof is more or less broken up by vacuities
exposing the true cranial walls. The ethmoidal region is the
only one in which much of the primordial cartilaginous cranium
remains. The lateral parts of the sphenoidal region are also
as a rule not well ossified.</p>

<p>In some reptiles, such as most Lacertilia and Chelonia, the
orbits are separated only by the imperfect interorbital septum,
while in others, such as the Ophidia, Crocodilia and Amphisbaenidae,
the cranial cavity extends forwards between the
orbits.</p>

<p>In the occipital region all four bones are ossified. The
great majority of reptiles have a single convex occipital
condyle, but some of the Theromorpha such as <i>Cynognathus</i>
have two distinct condyles as in mammals. Sometimes, as
in Chelonia, Ophidia and Lacertilia, the exoccipitals, as well
as the basi-occipital, take part in the formation of the single
condyle; sometimes, as in Crocodiles, it is formed by the basi-occipital
alone, as in birds. The relations of the bones to the
foramen magnum vary considerably, in Chelonia the basi-occipital
generally takes no part in bounding it, and in the
Theromorpha, Crocodilia, and Ophidia, the supra-occipital is
excluded. The parietals are paired in Geckos and Chelonia
alone among living forms, and in the extinct Ichthyosauria
and some Theromorpha; in all other reptiles they are united.</p>

<p>The frontals are paired in Ichthyosauria (fig. 32, 5),
Chelonia, Ophidia, <i>Sphenodon</i> (fig. 52, B, 4) and some extinct
crocodiles, such as <i>Belodon</i>. They are completely fused in
living Crocodilia and some Lacertilia and Dinosauria. In
the gigantic <i>Polyonax</i> they are drawn out into a pair of
enormous horns, and the parietals and squamosals are greatly
expanded behind.</p>

<p>An interparietal foramen occurs in the Theromorpha, the
Ichthyosauria (fig. 32, 10), <i>Sphenodon</i>, the Sauropterygia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
most Lacertilia. The posterior part of the skull is curiously
modified in some Chamaeleons, the parietals and supra-occipitals
being drawn out into a backwardly-projecting sagittal crest
which unites with the two prolongations from the squamosals.
In other Chamaeleons (<i>C. bifidus</i>) prolongations of the prefrontals
and maxillae form large forwardly-projecting bony
processes.</p>

<p>The roof of the skull is characterised by the development
of prefrontals and postfrontals, which lie respectively near the
anterior and posterior extremity of the orbit. In Theromorpha,
Squamata, Crocodilia, and some Dinosauria lachrymals are
developed. There is a ring of bones in the sclerotic in the
Ichthyosauria (fig. 32, 15), the Metriorhynchidae among Crocodiles
and some Rhynchocephalia, Dinosauria, and Pterosauria.</p>

<p>The pro-otic lies in front of the exoccipital and together
with the opisthotic forms the hind border of the fenestra
ovalis. In Chelonia the opisthotic remains separate, in all other
living reptiles it fuses with the exoccipital. The epi-otic fuses
with the supra-occipital.</p>

<p>The parasphenoid, so important in Ichthyopsids, has very
often disappeared completely; it is present, however, in the
Ichthyosauria, the Plesiosauridae, and a number of Squamata,
in many Ophidia its anterior part forming the base of the
interorbital septum.</p>

<p>In the Plesiosauridae and most Lacertilia, but not in the
Amphisbaenidae, a slender bone, the epipterygoid, occurs uniting
the parietal or the anterior end of the pro-otic with the
pterygoid. A homologous arrangement occurs in the Ichthyosauria
and some Chelonia.</p>

<p>In most reptiles a transpalatine occurs, connecting the
maxillae with the pterygoid, but this is absent in the Chelonia,
and some Dinosauria, and in the Typhlopidae among snakes.</p>

<p>The quadrate is always well developed, and except in the
Squamata is firmly fixed to the surrounding bones. The
Chamaeleons also, among the Squamata, have a fixed quadrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and in them too the quadratojugal is absent. Separate nasal
bones do not occur in any living Chelonia.</p>

<p>The vomers are generally paired as in Squamata, sometimes
unpaired as in Chelonia.</p>

<p>The disposition of the bones of the jaws is subject to
much modification in the Ophidia in order to adapt them for
swallowing very large prey. The arrangements again differ
greatly in the venomous and non-venomous snakes. In the
non-venomous snakes, such as <i>Python</i> and <i>Tropidonotus</i>, the
palatine is large and is fixed to the pterygoid which extends
outwards (fig. 51, 10) so as to be united to the quadrate, and
is at the same time firmly connected by the transpalatine with
the maxillae. The quadrate is united to the squamosal, which
is loosely attached to the cranium. The premaxillae is moderately
developed and bears teeth, and the maxillae forms a long
bar loosely connected with the rest of the skull. The rami of
the mandible are united only by an extremely elastic ligament.
It is as regards the maxillae and premaxillae that the skulls
of venomous and non-venomous snakes differ most. In the
rattlesnake (<i>Crotalus</i>) and other venomous snakes the premaxillae
is extremely small and toothless. The maxillae is
small and subcylindrical, and is movably articulated to the
lachrymal, which also is capable of a certain amount of motion
on the frontal. The maxillae is connected by means of the
transpalatine with the pterygoid, which in its turn is united
to the quadrate. When the mouth is shut the quadrate is
directed backwards, and carrying back the pterygoid and
transpalatine pulls at the maxillae and causes its palatal face,
to which the poison teeth are attached, to lie back along the
roof of the mouth. When the mouth opens the distal end
of the quadrate is thrust forward, and this necessitates the
pushing forward of the pterygoid and transpalatine, causing
the tooth-bearing surface of the maxillae to look downwards
and the tooth to come into the position for striking.</p>

<p>The Ophidian skull is also noticeable for the absence of the
jugals and quadratojugals. In poisonous snakes the place of
the jugal is taken by the zygomatic ligament which connects
the quadrate and maxillae.</p>

<p>The extent to which the palate is closed in reptiles varies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
much. In many reptiles, such as the Squamata and Ichthyosauria,
the palate is not complete, both palatines and pterygoids
being widely separated in the middle line. In others, such as
the Crocodilia, Sauropterygia, and Chelonia, there is a more
or less complete bony palate. In many Chelonia this is
chiefly formed of the vomer, palatines, and pterygoids, the
posterior nares being mainly bounded by the palatines. In
living Crocodilia, however, outgrowths are formed from the
pterygoids and palatines which arch round and meet one
another ventrally, forming a secondary palate (fig. 43, A),
which completely shuts off the true sphenoidal floor of the
skull, and causes the posterior nares which are bounded by
the pterygoids to open very far back. Though this feature
is common to all postsecondary crocodiles, it is interesting to
notice that it is not found in the earlier forms, but that its
gradual evolution can be traced. In the Triassic <i>Belodon</i>, for
instance, the posterior nares open far forwards, and are not
surrounded by either the palatines or pterygoids. In the
Jurassic crocodile, <i>Teleosaurus</i>, the posterior nares lie further
back, being surrounded by the palatines, but the pterygoids
do not meet them. Finally, in the Tertiary forms the arrangements
are as in living crocodiles.</p>

<p>A short secondary hard palate is found also in the Theriodontia.
The palatines of <i>Ichthyosaurus</i> are noticeable for their
transverse position, which recalls that in the Frog.</p>

<p>The various <b>fossae</b> or <b>vacuities</b> in the false roof of the
skull are important, and their relations may best be understood
by a description of their mode of occurrence in <i>Sphenodon</i>, a
form in which they are very completely developed.</p>

<p>In <i>Sphenodon</i>, then, on the dorsal surface of the skull, are
the large <b>supratemporal fossae</b> (fig. 52, 20). Their inner
margins are separated from one another by the parietal walls
of the cranium, while externally each is bounded by a bony
arch, the <b>supratemporal arcade</b>, formed of the postfrontal,
postorbital, and squamosal. Posteriorly the boundary is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
formed by a <b>post-temporal bar</b>, formed by the parietal and
squamosal. Below the supratemporal arcade is another large
vacuity, the <b>infratemporal</b> or <b>lateral temporal fossa</b> (fig.
52, 21). This is bounded above by the supratemporal arcade,
and is separated from the orbit in front by the <b>postorbital
bar</b>, formed by the union of outgrowths from the jugals and
postorbitals. Behind it is bounded by a continuation of the
post-temporal bar formed of the squamosal and quadratojugal,
and below by an <b>infratemporal arcade</b>, which is chiefly composed
of the quadratojugal and jugal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Below the post-temporal bar is a third vacuity, the
<b>post-temporal fossa</b> (fig. 52, D, 23), bounded above by
the post-temporal bar and below by the exoccipital and
opisthotic.</p>

<p><i>Sphenodon</i> and the Crocodilia are the only living reptiles
with complete supratemporal and infratemporal arcades, but
they are both present in the extinct Pterosauria and some
Dinosauria.</p>

<p>Supratemporal fossae, bounded below by supratemporal
arcades, occur in all reptiles except some Chelonia, the Ophidia,
the Geckonidae among Lacertilia, and the Pariasauria and
others among Theromorpha; they are specially large in <i>Nothosaurus</i>
among the Sauropterygia, <i>Dicynodon</i> among the
Theromorpha, and many Crocodilia and Pterosauria. In some
Dinosaurs, such as <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, they are very small, while
the infratemporal fossae are correspondingly large.</p>

<p>In <i>Elginia</i><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> (Theromorpha) and some Chelonia, such as
<i>Chelone</i>, there are no fossae on the surface of the skull,
a complete false roof being developed; in other Chelonia,
such as <i>Trionyx</i>, the true cranium is freely visible, the only
part of the false roof developed being the infratemporal
arcade.</p>

<p>In many reptiles large <b>pre-orbital vacuities</b> occur; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
are specially large in the Pterosauria and in some of the
Crocodilia and Dinosauria (fig. 35, 3). In some Pterosauria
they are confluent with the orbits.</p>

<p>The premaxillae are usually separate, but sometimes, as in
some Ophidia (fig. 51, 1), Chelonia, Lacertilia (Agamidae),
and Dinosaurs (Ceratopsia) they are united. In the Dinosaur
<i>Hadrosaurus</i> they are exceedingly large and spatulate. In
the Rhynchocephalian <i>Hyperodapedon</i> they are drawn out into
a strongly curved beak.</p>

<p>As regards the mandible, sometimes, as in most Rhynchocephalia,
Ophidia and Pythonomorpha, the rami have only a
ligamental union; sometimes, as in Crocodilia, the Rhynchosauridae
and the majority of Lacertilia, they are suturally
united. In Chelonia (fig. 28, B, 12), and apparently in Pterosauria,
the two dentaries are completely fused together. The
sutures between the various bones of the lower jaw usually
persist, but in Ophidia those between the angular, supra-angular,
articular and coronoid are obliterated. There are
sometimes large vacuities in the mandible, as in Theromorpha,
Crocodilia, and some Dinosauria. In <i>Iguanodon</i>, <i>Polyonax</i>,
<i>Hypsilophodon</i> and <i>Hadrosaurus</i> among Dinosaurs the mandible
has a predentary or mento-meckelian bone which, in
some cases at any rate, was probably sheathed in a horny
beak.</p>

<p>The principal part of the auditory ossicular chain is formed
by a rod-like columella. The development of the hyoid apparatus
varies, and it often happens that the first branchial arch
is better developed than is the hyoid arch. In the Crocodilia
and Chelonia there is a large basilingual plate or body of the
hyoid (fig. 53, 1); but while in the Crocodilia the first branchial
forms the only well-developed arch, in the Chelonia the first
and second branchials are both strongly developed, and the
hyoid is often fairly large.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Ribs are always present, and may be attached to any of the
precaudal vertebrae. In most reptiles the posterior cervical
vertebrae bear ribs, while the atlas and axis are ribless; in
Crocodiles and Geckos, however, ribs are borne even by the
atlas and axis. On the other hand, in the Chelonia none of
the cervical vertebrae bear obvious ribs. In the following
groups the thoracic ribs have both capitula and tubercula&mdash;Theromorpha,
Ichthyosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Pterosauria.
In the other groups each rib articulates by a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
head, and the position of the facet is subject to a considerable
amount of variation, thus in the Squamata it lies on the
centrum, and in the Sauropterygia on the neural arch, while
in the Chelonia the rib articulates with the contiguous parts
of two centra instead of directly with one.</p>

<p>In most reptiles a greater or smaller number of ribs are
united ventrally with a sternum; but in snakes a continuous
series of similar ribs, all articulating freely with the vertebral
column, extends from the third cervical vertebra to the end of
the trunk. The number of ribs connected with the sternum
varies from three or four in Lizards to eight or nine in Crocodiles.
Those which reach the sternum are nearly always
divided into vertebral, sternal, and intermediate portions, and
as a rule only the vertebral portion is completely ossified. In
Crocodiles a number of sternal ribs are connected with a
cartilaginous arch, which is attached to the hind end of the
sternum, and represents the xiphisternum. The sacral ribs
connecting the vertebral column with the ilia are very
distinct in Crocodiles; in these animals and <i>Sphenodon</i> the
vertebral ribs have backwardly-projecting uncinate processes
as in birds.</p>

<p>In the curious arboreal lizard, <i>Draco volans</i>, the posterior
ribs are long and straight, and support a parachute-like expansion
of the integument used in its long flight-like leaps. In
Chelonia the ribs are generally combined with the carapace.</p>

<p>In Ichthyosauria, Sauropterygia, Crocodilia and <i>Sphenodon</i>,
abdominal splint ribs occur; and probably all except the first
of the paired ossifications forming the plastron of Chelonia are
of similar character. Abdominal ribs have quite a different
origin from true ribs, for while true ribs are cartilage bones,
abdominal ribs have no cartilaginous precursors, but are
simply the ossified tendons of the rectus abdominalis muscle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sternum.</span></p>

<p>A sternum occurs in the following groups of reptiles:
Rhynchocephalia, nearly all Lacertilia, Pythonomorpha, Crocodilia,
and Pterosauria, and is generally more or less rhomboidal
or shield-shaped. In Pterosauria it is keeled and bears some
resemblance to that of birds. It may have been replaced by
membrane bone.</p>

<p>The sternum is absent in Sauropterygia, Ichthyosauria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Chelonia, Ophidia, and most of the snake-like Amphisbaenidae
among Lacertilia; while it is not well known in Theromorpha
and Dinosauria. In the Sauropod <i>Brontosaurus</i>, however, two
rounded bones occur near the base of the coracoids, and these
probably represent ossified patches in a sternum, which was
mainly cartilaginous; similar structures occur in <i>Iguanodon</i>.</p>

<p>The sternum frequently remains wholly cartilaginous,
especially in Lacertilia; sometimes it becomes calcified, but
true ossification does not as a rule take place.</p>


<p>APPENDICULAR SKELETON.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pectoral girdle is well developed in all groups of
reptiles except the Ophidia, occurring even in the limbless
Amphisbaenidae. It is very solid in the Theromorpha. As a
rule all three cartilage bones, scapula, coracoid, and precoracoid
are represented, and frequently also the membrane bones,&mdash;clavicles,
and interclavicle.</p>

<p>The coracoids are generally flat expanded bones, which
sometimes, as in Sauropterygia and Ichthyosauria, meet in a
ventral symphysis; sometimes, as in Lacertilia, are united with
the sides of the sternum. In Chelonia neither the coracoids
nor precoracoids meet one another, but their free ends are
connected by fibrocartilaginous bands. In Lacertilia the
coracoids are pierced by fenestrae.</p>

<p>The precoracoid is generally represented, but the Theromorpha
are the only reptiles in which it is separately ossified;
it forms a well-marked process on the coracoid in Lacertilia
(fig. 54, 5). It is absent in Ichthyosauria, and Dinosauria,
and probably in Sauropterygia. In some Lacertilia and
Chelonia the sternal ends of the coracoids are unossified and
form epicoracoids; in some Chelonia there are also epiprecoracoids;
but neither these nor the epicoracoids overlap their
fellows of the opposite side as they do in arciferous Anura
(see p. 185). In some Lacertilia with degenerate limbs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
pectoral girdle is also much reduced, in <i>Ophisaurus apus</i> the
ventral borders of the coracoids are widely separated.</p>

<p>A scapula is always present, and is generally expanded
distally, but in the Chelonia the distal end is cylindrical. In
the Theromorpha it has an acromial process with which the
precoracoid articulates, and it is very large in Dinosauria.
In the Chelonia the scapula and precoracoid are ossified
continuously. Among the Pterosauria, <i>Pteranodon</i> has an
unique pectoral girdle; the scapula and coracoid are ankylosed
and the scapula articulates with the neural spines of several
ankylosed vertebrae.</p>

<p>Clavicles occur in some Theromorpha such as <i>Pariasaurus</i>,
and also in the Ichthyosauria, Sauropterygia, Rhynchocephalia,
and most Lacertilia. They are absent in the Pterosauria, the
Chamaeleons among Lacertilia, the Ophidia and the Crocodilia.
They are wanting too in the Chelonia, unless the first pair of
ossifications in the plastron are to be regarded as clavicles. In
the Sauropterygia bones regarded as the clavicles and interclavicle
are generally well developed. The unpaired ossification
in the plastron of Chelonia is an interclavicle, and a representative
of the same bone occurs arising from the sternum in
Pterosauria. A well developed <b>T</b>-shaped interclavicle is found
in Ichthyosauria, Rhynchocephalia, Lacertilia, and some Theromorpha,
such as <i>Pariasaurus</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Limbs.</span></p>

<p>In most reptiles there are two pairs of pentedactylate
limbs provided with claws, but in nearly all Ophidia and
some Lacertilia (<i>Amphisbaena</i>, <i>Lialis</i>, <i>Anguis</i>) the limbs have
entirely disappeared. In a few Ophidia such as <i>Python</i> traces
of the posterior limbs occur, and in <i>Chirotes</i> among the Amphisbaenidae
there are minute anterior limbs. The Lacertilians,
<i>Chalcides</i> (<i>Seps</i>) and <i>Ophisaurus</i> (<i>Bipes</i>, <i>Pseudopus</i>) have very
small posterior limbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>The limbs are as a rule adapted for walking, but in Ichthyosauria,
Sauropterygia, Pythonomorpha and some Chelonia, they
have the form of swimming paddles, the relative size of the manus
and pes being increased, while that of the proximal and middle
portions of the limbs is reduced. This reduction is carried to its
furthest extent in the Ichthyosauria in which radius and ulna,
tibia and fibula, have the form of short polygonal bones similar
to those constituting the manus and pes. In the Pythonomorpha
the reduction of the limb bones is not quite so marked,
in the Sauropterygia it is less, and still less in the Chelonia.
In the earlier Ichthyosauria too, the limb bones are not so
short as they are in the later forms. The Ichthyosaurian limb
is also remarkable, firstly for the fact that both humerus and
femur are terminated by concave articulating surfaces instead
of by convex condyles, and secondly for the great multiplication
of the phalangeal bones, each digit being sometimes composed of
a series of over twenty. Sometimes too the number of series is
increased, either by the bifurcation of some of the digits or by
the development of marginal bones. In the Sauropterygia the
phalanges are likewise increased above the normal but not so
much as in Ichthyosauria. The humerus and femur of Sauropterygia
are noticeable for the enormous size of the terminal
epiphyses which form in each case by far the greater part of
the bone.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Anterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>The anterior limb is usually approximately equal in
length to the posterior, but in many Dinosauria it is considerably
the shorter of the two. The humerus is generally without
distinct condyles, but they are well developed in the Theromorpha,
the Lacertilia and <i>Sphenodon</i>.</p>

<p>In the Theromorpha, some Rhynchocephalia, and some
Sauropterygia, such as <i>Mesosaurus</i>, the humerus has an ent-epicondylar
foramen; in Lacertilia, Chelonia and some Dinosauria
there is an ect-epicondylar foramen or groove; <i>Sphenodon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
possesses both ent- and ect-epicondylar foramina. The radius
and ulna are always separate. In some Chelonia, such as
<i>Chelydra</i>, the carpus has a very simple arrangement, namely,
a proximal row of three bones, the radiale, intermedium and
ulnare, and a distal row of five carpalia, with one bone, the
centrale, between the two rows. Many reptiles have a carpus
only slightly different from this. Thus the carpus in <i>Sphenodon</i>
differs mainly in having two centralia, that of most Lacertilia,
in having the centrale and intermedium fused.</p>

<p>Crocodiles have a much reduced carpus with the radiale
and ulnare considerably elongated. The manus in Chamaeleons
is curiously modified, having the first three digits arranged in
one group and turned inwards, and the fourth and fifth in
another group turned outwards; carpalia 3 and 4 are united.</p>

<p>In the Pterosauria the anterior limbs form wings, the
phalanges of the fifth digit being very greatly elongated to
support the wing membrane. The first digit is vestigial and
the second, third, and fourth are clawed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic girdle is well developed in all reptiles which
have posterior limbs, but is absent or quite vestigial in Ophidia
and those Lacertilia which have no posterior limbs. The ilium
and ischium agree in their general characters throughout all
the various groups of reptiles, but that is not the case with
the pubis.</p>

<p>In many reptiles such as Chelonia, Ichthyosauria and
Lacertilia the ilia are small, more or less cylindrical bones
either directed backwards, or vertically placed as in the
Chamaeleons. In the Crocodilia they are larger and more expanded,
while in Dinosauria and Pterosauria they are greatly
elongated both in front of, and behind, the acetabulum. The
ischia are generally strongly developed somewhat square bones
meeting in a ventral symphysis. In Dinosauria the ischium
(fig. 35, 9) is a much elongated and backwardly-directed bone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
bearing a forwardly projecting obturator process. In Pterosauria
the ischium is fused with the ilium, and in both pterosaurs
and crocodiles the ilium and ischium are the only bones
taking part in the formation of the acetabulum. In most
Lacertilia there is an unpaired structure, the <i>hypo-ischium</i> or
<i>os cloacae</i> projecting back from the symphysis ischii, which is
usually separated from the symphysis pubis by a large space,
the <i>foramen cordiforme</i>. In some Lacertilia and Chelonia
there is a cartilaginous bar dividing the foramen cordiforme
into two obturator foramina; in many Chelonia this bar is
ossified. Among <i>Ophidia</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Tortrix</i>, <i>Typhlops</i> and their
allies have a structure representing a vestigial ischio-pubis:
but in most Ophidia there is no trace of the pelvis. In some
Theromorpha all the bones of the pelvis are completely fused,
forming an os innominatum as in mammals; the pubes and
ischia are so completely fused that sometimes as in <i>Pariasaurus</i>
even the obturator foramina are closed.</p>

<p>Concerning the reptilian pubis there are considerable difficulties.
Sometimes there is only a single pubic structure
present, sometimes there are two. The reptilian pubis is best
understood by comparing the arrangements met with in the
various other groups with that in the Orthopod Dinosaurs
such as <i>Iguanodon</i>. In <i>Iguanodon</i> the pubis consists of two
portions, viz. of a moderately broad pre-pubis directed downwards
and forwards, and of a narrow greatly elongated post-pubis
directed backwards parallel to the ischium. The pubis
is united to both ilium and ischium, the acetabulum has a
large unossified space, and neither pre-pubes nor post-pubes
meet in ventral symphyses. The arrangement bears a great
resemblance to that of Ratite birds. In Lacertilia, Chelonia,
Rhynchocephalia and Ichthyosauria together with Theropod
and Sauropod Dinosaurs the pubis corresponds to the pre-pubis
of <i>Iguanodon</i> and is a more or less cylindrical bone expanded
at both ends, meeting its fellow in a ventral symphysis. In
Chelonia and Lacertilia the pubis bears a lateral process which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
is homologous with the post-pubis of Iguanodon. In Lacertilia
and sometimes in Chelonia there is a cartilaginous epipubis
attached to the anterior border of the pubic symphysis; this is
well developed in the Chamaeleons and Geckos. In Crocodilia
there is, forming the anterior and ventral portion of the
acetabulum, a patch of cartilage (fig. 49, 3) which is probably
the true pubis homologous with that of lizards and with the
pre-pubis of <i>Iguanodon</i>. The large bone generally called the
pubis in Crocodiles is probably an epipubis.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Posterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>The posterior limb is entirely absent in some Lacertilia and
in most Ophidia, though traces occur in <i>Python</i>, <i>Tortrix</i> and
<i>Typhlops</i>. In the Ichthyosauria, Sauropterygia and Pythonomorpha
the posterior limbs form swimming paddles and have
been already referred to.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the proximal and middle segments of
the limb is fairly constant in all reptiles with limbs adapted
for walking, and the tibia and fibula are always separate.
The pes is however subject to a considerable amount of variation,
especially as regards the tarsus. In some Chelonia the
tarsus like the carpus has an extremely simple arrangement,
consisting of a proximal row of three bones, the tibiale, intermedium
and fibulare, a centrale, and a distal row of five tarsalia.
In most living reptiles, however, the tibiale and intermedium
are as in mammals united, forming the astragalus.
In Crocodiles (fig. 48, B, 15) the centrale is also united with
the tibiale while the distal tarsalia are very slightly developed.
The calcaneum in Crocodiles is drawn out into a long process
forming a heel in a manner almost unique among Sauropsida.
In <i>Sphenodon</i> and Lacertilia the tibia and fibula articulate
with a single large bone representing the whole proximal row
of tarsalia.</p>

<p>The pes is generally pentedactylate, but in some Crocodiles
the fifth digit is vestigial (fig. 48, B), and in some Dinosauria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
(fig. 35) there are only three digits. The North American Dinosaurs
present a continuous series ranging from a pentedactylate
plantigrade form like <i>Morosaurus</i>, to such a form as <i>Hallopus</i>
with a highly digitigrade and specialised pes reduced to three
functional digits, and a vestigial fifth metatarsal. The second,
third and fourth metatarsals in this form are nearly two-thirds
as long as the femur, and the calcaneum is drawn out
into a heel much as it is in most mammals.</p>

<p>In Lacertilia, Orthopoda and many Chelonia, the ankle
joint comes to lie between the proximal and distal row of
tarsals as in birds.</p>

<p>Birds form a large and extremely homogeneous class of the
vertebrata, and are readily distinguished from all other animals
by the possession of an epidermal exoskeleton having the form
of feathers. Feathers differ from hairs in the fact that they
grow from papillae formed of both the horny and the Malpighian
layer of the epidermis, which papillae at first project
from the surface, and only subsequently become imbedded in
pits of the dermis. A dermal exoskeleton does not occur in
birds.</p>

<p>The endoskeleton is characterised by its lightness, the
large bones being generally hollow; but the pneumaticity
does not vary in proportion to the power of flight. The
cervical part of the vertebral column is very long and flexible,
while the post-cervical portion is generally very rigid, owing
to the fusion of many of the vertebrae, especially in the
lumbar and sacral regions. The vertebrae are generally without
epiphyses to their centra. The cervical vertebrae in living
forms have saddle-shaped articulating surfaces, and many of
them bear ribs. The thoracic ribs in almost all birds have
large uncinate processes. The sternum is very large, and the
ribs are always attached to its sides, not as in many reptiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to any backwardly-projecting process or processes. The sternum
ossifies from two or more centres.</p>

<p>The skull is extremely light, and its component bones show
a great tendency to fuse together completely. The facial part
of the skull is prolonged into a beak, chiefly formed of the premaxillae;
this beak is in all modern birds devoid of teeth,
and is coated externally with a horny epidermal sheath. The
quadrate is large and freely movable. The supratemporal
arcade[1] is imperfect, while the infratemporal arcade<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> is complete.
There are no postorbital or postfrontal bones. Neither
parotic processes nor an interparietal foramen occur. There
are commonly large pre-orbital vacuities. The palatines
and pterygoids never form a secondary bony palate as in
Crocodiles. Part of the floor of the skull is formed by a
wide <i>basitemporal</i> (paired in the embryo) which is continued
in front as a long slender <i>rostrum</i>; these structures have replaced
the parasphenoid of Ichthyopsids. Cartilage or bone is
always developed in the sclerotic. The first branchial arch is
well developed, the hyoid arch but slightly. The coracoids
are large, and the clavicles are nearly always united forming
the <i>furcula</i>. There is no separate interclavicle and hardly any
trace of a precoracoid.</p>

<p>The anterior limbs form wings, and the manus is in the
adult always much modified, never having more than three
digits. The three bones of the pelvis are, except in Archaeornithes,
always ankylosed together in the adult, and the ilium
is greatly prolonged in front of the acetabulum, which is
perforated. The ilia are not connected with the sacrum by
ossified sacral ribs. The pubes and ischia are directed backwards
parallel to one another, and except in a very few forms
never meet their fellows in ventral symphyses. The fibula
is generally much reduced. The proximal tarsal bones are
always ankylosed to the tibia, and the distal tarsals to the
metatarsals, so that the ankle joint is <i>intertarsal</i>. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
metatarsal is nearly always free. The pes never has more than
four digits in the adult.</p>

<p>The class Aves is most conveniently divided into two subclasses:
1. Archaeornithes. 2. Neornithes.</p>


<p class="cen">Subclass I. <span class="smcap">Archaeornithes.</span></p>

<p>The only form referred to this subclass of extinct birds is
<i>Archaeopteryx</i><a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, the earliest known bird. In this animal the
skeleton does not seem to be pneumatic. The cervical and
trunk vertebrae are generally thought to be flat, certainly
their articulating surfaces are not saddle-shaped. There is no
long compound sacrum as in modern birds. The tail is longer
than the whole body, the caudal vertebrae are twenty in
number, they gradually taper as traced away from the trunk,
and each bears a pair of feathers. The posterior caudal
vertebrae are not united together to form a <i>pygostyle</i>. The
upper jaw bears thirteen pairs of conical teeth, planted in
distinct sockets in the maxillae and premaxillae, but the
mandible has only three pairs. The presence of these teeth
forms the most essential difference between the skull of
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and that of modern birds, and the fact that
they occur on the premaxillae renders it improbable that
a horny beak was present. There is a ring of ossifications
in the sclerotic. The ribs do not show uncinate processes,
and articulate with the vertebrae by single heads not divided
into capitula and tubercula. Abdominal ribs appear to have
been present. The furcula is large, and the scapula has a well
developed acromion. The sternum is unknown. The radius
and ulna are approximately equal in size. In the manus the
first, second and third digits<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> are present, each terminated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a claw. The second digit is considerably the longest, while
the third includes four phalanges. The three bones of the
pelvis probably remained distinct throughout life. The tarsals
are ankylosed respectively to the tibia and metatarsals as in
other birds. The metatarsals are ankylosed together, and the
pes has four digits.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Subclass II.</i> <span class="smcap">Neornithes.</span></p>

<p>To this subclass may be referred all known birds except
<i>Archaeopteryx</i>. They all agree in having a short tail whose
component vertebrae are commonly ankylosed together forming
a pygostyle. The three metacarpals do not all remain
distinct. The bones of the pelvis are ankylosed together,
and to a large though variable number of vertebrae. There
are three orders, the Ratitae, Odontolcae, and Carinatae.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> 1. <span class="smcap">Ratitae.</span></p>

<p>The Ratitae differ from <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the great
majority of Carinatae in being flightless. The bones are
generally not pneumatic, containing marrow instead of air,
in the Ostrich however they are very pneumatic. The tail
is short and the posterior caudal vertebrae are generally
ankylosed together forming a pygostyle. The pectoral girdle
has comparatively a much smaller size than in Carinatae,
clavicles are small or absent, and the scapula and coracoid
lie nearly in the same straight line. The ilium and ischium
do not as in Carinatae unite posteriorly, and enclose a
foramen except in very old Rheas and Emeus. The quadrate
articulates with the cranium by a single head. The vomers
unite and form a broad plate, separating the palatines, pterygoids
and basisphenoidal rostrum.</p>

<p>The anterior limbs are greatly reduced in size or even
absent, while the posterior limbs are greatly developed and
adapted for running. The tibia and fibula are quite distinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Many ornithologists agree that the various forms grouped
together as Ratitae are not all very closely allied to one another,
that they resemble one another mainly in having lost the power
of flight, and do not form a natural group.</p>

<p>The Ratitae include the following groups:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>&AElig;pyornithes</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, huge extinct birds from Madagascar.</p>

<p><i>Apteryges</i>, including the Apteryx of New Zealand.</p>

<p><i>Dinornithes</i><a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, the Moas, huge extinct birds from New
Zealand, and some of the neighbouring islands.</p>

<p><i>Megistanes</i>, including the Cassowaries (<i>Casuarius</i>) of Australia,
New Guinea, and some of the neighbouring islands;
and the Emeus (<i>Dromaeus</i>) of Australia.</p>

<p><i>Rheornithes</i>, including the Rheas of S. America.</p>

<p><i>Struthiornithes</i>, including the Ostriches (<i>Struthio</i>) now living
in Africa, and found fossil in N. India and Samos.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> 2. <span class="smcap">Odontolcae.</span></p>

<p>This order includes only an extinct N. American bird
<i>Hesperornis</i><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. The jaws are provided with a series of sharp
teeth placed in continuous grooves, but the premaxillae are
toothless, and were probably sheathed in a horny beak. The
rami of the mandible are not ankylosed together in front.
The skeleton is not pneumatic. The cervical vertebrae have
saddle-shaped articulating surfaces as in ordinary birds, and
the thoracic vertebrae are not ankylosed together. The tail
is comparatively long, and formed of twelve vertebrae with
only slight indications of a pygostyle. The ribs have uncinate
processes. The anterior limb is quite vestigial, being reduced
to a slender humerus. The posterior limb is very powerful
and adapted for swimming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order</i> 3. <span class="smcap">Carinatae.</span></p>

<p>This order includes the vast majority of living birds.
The cervical vertebrae have saddle-shaped articulating surfaces
(except in the Ichthyornithiformes). The posterior caudal
vertebrae are ankylosed forming a pygostyle. The quadrate
articulates with the cranium by a double head. In all except
the Tinamidae the vomers are narrow behind and not interposed
between the palatines, pterygoids and basisphenoidal
rostrum. The sternum has a median keel, and the anterior
limbs are in the great majority of cases adapted for flight.
Clavicles are well developed, and the scapula and coracoid are
nearly at right angles to one another. The various groups
into which the Carinatae are divisible are shown in the table
on pp. 40-42. Their special characters will not be dealt with.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE WILD DUCK
(<i>Anas boschas</i>).</small></h2>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton of the Duck and indeed of all birds is
entirely epidermal in origin. Its most important part consists
of <b>feathers</b>, but it includes also the following horny structures:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>scales</b>, which cover the toes and tarso-metatarsus;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>claws</b>, which are attached to the distal phalanges of
the toes and of the pollex;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) the wide <b>beak</b>, which sheaths both upper and lower
jaws, and whose edges are raised into lamellae, which act as
strainers.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Feathers.</span></p>

<p>A well developed feather, such as one of the large
quill feathers of the wing or tail, consists of the following
parts: A main stem, the <b>scapus</b>, which forms the axis
running along the whole length of the feather, and is divided
into (1) a proximal hollow cylindrical portion, the <b>calamus</b> or
<b>quill</b>, and (2) a distal solid portion, the <b>rachis</b> or <b>shaft</b>, which
is square in section, flexible and grooved along its ventral
surface, and bears a number of lateral processes, the <b>barbs</b>.
The <b>calamus</b> which is partly imbedded in a pit in the dermis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
bears two holes: one, the <b>inferior umbilicus</b>, is at its
proximal end, and into it enters a vascular outgrowth from the
dermis; the other, the <b>superior umbilicus</b>, lies on the
ventral surface at the junction of the calamus and scapus.</p>

<p>The <b>barbs</b> are a series of narrow elastic plates, attached
by their bases to the rachis, and with their edges looking
upwards and downwards. The barbs are connected together
by a number of smaller processes, the <b>barbules</b>, which interlock
with one another by means of hooklets, and bear the
same relation to the barbs that the barbs do to the rachis.
The barbs and barbules, together with the rachis, constitute
the <b>vexillum</b> or <b>vane</b> of the feather. Any feather having
the above type of structure is called a <b>penna</b> or a <b>contour
feather</b>, from the fact that it helps to produce the contour of
the body.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Varieties of feathers.</span></p>

<p>1. <b>Pennae.</b> There are two kinds of pennae or contour
feathers.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <b>quills</b>. These form the large feathers of the
wing and tail. They are divided into two groups, the
<b>remiges</b>, or wing quills, and the <b>rectrices</b>, or tail quills.</p>

<p>The <b>remiges</b><a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> include three sets of feathers, the <b>primaries</b>
or <b>metacarpo-digitals</b>, which are attached to the bones of
the manus, the <b>secondaries</b> or <b>cubitals</b>, which are attached
to the ulna, and the <b>humerals</b>, which are attached to the
humerus.</p>

<p>The <b>primaries</b> differ from all the other quill feathers
in having the posterior half of the vane much wider than the
anterior half. They are ten in number, and of these six,
the <b>metacarpal</b> quills (fig. 57, 14), are attached to the second
and third metacarpals, one, the <b>ad-digital</b> (fig. 57, 15), to the
phalanx of the third digit, two, the <b>mid-digitals</b> (fig. 57, 16),
to the first phalanx of the second digit, and two, the <b>pre-digitals</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
(fig. 51, 17), to the second phalanx of the second digit. One
of the pre-digitals is very small, and is called the <b>remicle</b>
(fig. 57, 11).</p>

<p>In addition, a group of three quill feathers is attached to
the first digit, constituting the <b>bastard wing</b> or <b>ala spuria</b>
(fig. 56, 4).</p>

<p>The <b>secondaries</b> or <b>cubitals</b> (fig. 56, 8) form a group of
seventeen feathers, attached to the ulna; they are shorter than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the primaries, and do not have the posterior half of the vane
much wider than the anterior half.</p>

<p>(b) The <b>tectrices</b> or <b>coverts</b> are short feathers, which
cover over the quills of the rectrices and remiges, and clothe
the body generally. Their barbules are less developed than is
the case with the quill feathers, so that the barbs separate
readily from one another, especially at the base of the vane.
The nomenclature of the various patches of coverts on the
wings is seen in fig. 56. A small patch of backwardly-directed
feathers surrounding the external auditory opening are known
as the <b>auriculars</b>.</p>

<p>2. The <b>filoplumes</b> are rudimentary feathers, consisting
of a minute stem and slightly developed vane. They are left
in the skin after the other feathers have been removed.</p>

<p>3. The <b>plumulae</b>, or down feathers, have the stem very
slightly developed, while the barbs are soft and free from one
another. They are distributed all over the body, not only
among the contour feathers, but also over the spaces (<i>apteria</i>)
which bear no contour feathers.</p>

<p>In the young bird the rudiments of the new feathers are
formed at the bases of the embryonic down feathers, and as
they grow they push them out from the skin. The embryonic
down feathers however remain attached to the apices of the
new feathers till these have reached a length of about an
inch; they are then shed.</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>As compared with that of the Turtle or Crocodile, the
endoskeleton of the Duck is characterised by:</p>

<p>1. The great lightness of the bones, many of which contain
air cavities.</p>

<p>2. The tendency to become ankylosed together shown by
many of the bones.</p>

<p>3. The modification of the anterior limbs and girdle for
the purpose of flight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This, as in other vertebrates, is divisible into&mdash;</p>

<p>
A. The vertebral column.

B. The skull.

C. The ribs and sternum.
</p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral Column.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral column of the duck, like that of the great
majority of birds, presents a number of well-marked characteristics,
contrasting strongly with those of the generality of
higher vertebrates. The centra are always without epiphyses.
The neck is exceedingly long, about as long as all the rest of
the vertebral column put together, and is remarkable for its
flexibility. The trunk portion of the vertebral column on the
other hand is characterised by extreme rigidity, and the
marked tendency shown by the component vertebrae to fuse
together into one almost continuous mass. The most rigid
part of the vertebral column is that to which the pelvis is
united, as no less than seventeen vertebrae take part in the
union. The tail of the duck, like that of all living birds, is
very short, and the posterior caudal vertebrae are united
<ins class="mycorr" title='Correction: text was "togther"'>together</ins>, forming the <b>pygostyle</b>. The vertebral column may
be divided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal
regions, but the boundaries between the several regions are ill-defined.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Cervical Vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>All the vertebrae anterior to the first one that bears a rib
meeting the sternum are regarded as cervical vertebrae.
There are therefore sixteen cervical vertebrae, the last two of
which bear well developed ribs. All are freely movable on
one another.</p>

<p>As a typical cervical vertebrae, any one from the fifth to
the ninth may be taken. The vertebra is rather elongated,
and is very lightly and strongly made, its most characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
feature being the shape of the articulating surfaces of the
centra, which are generally described as saddle-shaped. The
anterior surface is convex from above downward, and concave
from side to side, while the posterior and more prominent
surface is concave from above downwards and convex from
side to side. The neural arch is low, and is drawn out into a
slight blade-like <b>neural spine</b>. Its base is deeply notched on
both sides posteriorly for the exit of the spinal nerves. Above
these notches it is drawn out into two rather prominent
diverging processes, which bear the <b>postzygapophyses</b>,&mdash;two
flattened surfaces which look downwards and outwards.
The <b>transverse processes</b> form irregular outgrowths from
the anterior two-thirds of the sides of the vertebra; each
projects for a short distance downwards and outwards, and
is terminated posteriorly by a short backwardly-projecting
spine. The transverse processes are shown by development
to ossify from separate centres, and are therefore to be
regarded as cervical ribs, and each is perforated at its base by
a canal for the passage of the vertebral artery. Above the
anterior end of the vertebrarterial canal are a pair of
thickened outgrowths, which bear upwardly and inwardly
directed <b>prezygapophyses</b>. Each transverse process is
perforated near its middle by a prominent foramen through
which passes a vein which is connected with the jugular vein.</p>

<p>The third and fourth cervical vertebrae resemble the succeeding
ones in most respects, but have small <b>hypapophyses</b>,
and the neural spines are less blade-like. The posterior
cervical vertebrae (tenth to sixteenth) differ somewhat from
the middle ones. They are shorter and more massive, the
neural arch is much shorter, being deeply notched in the
middle line in front and behind. The transverse processes arise
from the anterior half of the vertebra only, and in the eleventh
vertebra each is drawn out below into a pair of rather prominent
downwardly and inwardly directed processes. In the
twelfth vertebra these processes have almost coalesced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
in the thirteenth vertebra they have coalesced completely,
forming a prominent <b>hypapophysis</b>. In the succeeding
vertebrae this hypapophysis rapidly decreases in size.</p>

<p>The fifteenth and sixteenth cervical vertebrae resemble the
succeeding thoracic vertebrae, having short thick centra and
prominent squarely truncated neural spines; the sides of the
neural arches are very deeply notched. The fifteenth vertebra
has a short transverse process, perforated by a wide vertebrarterial
foramen, but this foramen is absent in the sixteenth.
The transverse processes of the fifteenth vertebra bear two
facets for the articulation of the capitulum and tuberculum of
the rib. The sixteenth vertebra has its tubercular facet on
the transverse process, but the capitular facet is borne on the
centrum.</p>

<p>The second or <b>axis</b> vertebra is small, and has the centrum
drawn out into a comparatively very large hypapophysis. The
posterior articulating surface of the centrum is saddle-shaped,
the anterior nearly flat: above it the centrum is prolonged
into the prominent <b>odontoid process</b>, which is shown by
development to be the detached centrum of the atlas. The
neural arch is deeply notched in the middle line in front, and
at the sides behind. It is drawn out posteriorly into a wide
massive outgrowth, which overhangs the third vertebra and
bears the downwardly-directed postzygapophyses. The prezygapophyses
are situated at the sides of the anterior end of
the neural arch, and look directly outwards. The transverse
processes are very slightly developed, and are pierced by the
vertebrarterial canals.</p>

<p>The <b>atlas</b> vertebra is a very slight ring-like structure,
thickened ventrally and bearing in front a prominent concave
cavity for articulation with the occipital condyle of the skull.
Posteriorly it bears a more or less flattened surface for articulation
with the centrum of the axis. It surrounds a large
cavity partially divided into a larger dorsal portion, which is
the neural canal, and a smaller ventral portion which lodges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the odontoid process. The sides of the atlas are pierced by
the vertebrarterial canals, above which there are two slight
backwardly-projecting outgrowths bearing the postzygapophyses
on their inner faces.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Thoracic Vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The thoracic region includes all the vertebrae bearing free
ribs, except the first two, viz. those whose ribs do not reach
the sternum. There are seven thoracic vertebrae. The first
four have centra with saddle-shaped articulating surfaces, but
are more or less firmly united together by their neural spines;
the last two are completely ankylosed by their centra to the
lumbar vertebrae.</p>

<p>Each of the first five vertebrae has a prominent, vertical,
abruptly terminated neural spine, and straight transverse
processes. The zygapophyses and articulating surfaces at the
ends of the centra are well developed. The third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth vertebrae have very prominent hypapophyses. The
articular facets for the ribs are well marked, those for the tubercula
lying at the free ends of the transverse processes, and
those for the capitula at the sides of the anterior ends of the
centra. The sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae are firmly
fused by their centra and neural arches to one another and
to the lumbar vertebrae behind, and by their transverse processes
to the ilia. The sixth has its centrum terminated in
front by a saddle-shaped articulating surface, and bears a pair
of prominent prezygapophyses. Its transverse processes and
centrum bear facets for the tubercula and capitula of the ribs
respectively. In the seventh vertebra the tubercular facet is
wanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sacrum.</span></p>

<p>The <b>sacrum</b> generally consists of seventeen vertebrae
fused with one another and with the ilia. Their number may
be reckoned from the number of foramina for the exit of spinal
nerves. The two most anterior of these vertebrae bear ribs<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
and have been already described with the other thoracic
vertebrae. Their neural spines and those of the four succeeding
vertebrae are fused together, forming a continuous crest
of bone completely united laterally with the ilia. The transverse
processes of all these six vertebrae are well developed,
but those of the posterior two (fig. 58, B, 5) are much the
stoutest. The next three vertebrae have broad centra, but
their transverse processes are very slightly developed and have
no ventral elements. These seven vertebrae belong to the
<b>lumbar</b> series. The remaining eight vertebrae have well-developed
transverse processes, which in the case of the first
three or four are divisible into dorsal and ventral elements.
All the dorsal elements are united to form a pair of flattened
plates, partially separated by a series of foramina from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
median plate formed by the united neural arches. Laterally
they are continuous with the ischia. The first two of this
series of vertebrae are shown by their relation to the nerves
to be the true <b>sacrals</b> (fig. 58, B, 6), the remaining six belonging
to the <b>caudal</b> series.</p>

<p>Behind them come the six free caudal vertebrae, succeeded
by a terminal piece, the <b>pygostyle</b>, formed of a number of
vertebrae fused together; this bears the rectrices or tail quills.</p>

<p>The skull of the duck, like that of birds in general, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
characterised (1) by its lightness, (2) by the contrast between
the bones of the cranium proper and those forming the rest
of the skull, for the bones forming the cranium proper are
closely fused together, the sutures between them being nearly
all completely obliterated in the adult, while the bones forming
the face are loosely connected with the cranium proper;
(3) by the prolongation of the face into a long toothless beak;
(4) by the size of the orbits, and their position entirely in
front of the cranium, so that they are separated from one
another only by a thin interorbital septum.</p>

<p>For purposes of description the skull may be divided into</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(1) The cranial portion.</span></p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(2) The facial portion.</span></p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(3) The mandible.</span></p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(4) The hyoid.</span></p>


<p>(1) <span class="smcap">The Cranial portion.</span></p>

<p>This is a rounded box expanded dorsally and posteriorly,
but tapering antero-ventrally. In the young skull the divisional
lines between the several bones can be easily seen,
but in the adult they are quite obliterated.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>dorsal surface</i> is rounded, expanded in front and
behind, but encroached upon in the middle by the cavities of the
orbits. There is a prominent divisional line in front, separating
it from the facial part of the skull. It is formed mainly by
the <i>frontal</i> (fig. 59, A, 6) and <i>parietal</i> bones, but the frontals
diverge a little anteriorly and enclose between them the ends
of the <i>nasal processes</i> (fig. 59, A, 4) of the <i>premaxillae</i>. Just
in front of the orbit the outer margins of the frontals are
either notched or pierced by a pair of foramina.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At the <i>posterior end</i> of the cranium the most prominent
feature is the large, almost circular <b>foramen magnum</b>,
through which the spinal cord and brain communicate; this in
young birds is seen to be bounded by four distinct bones, dorsally
by the <b>supra-occipital</b>, ventrally by the <b>basi-occipital</b>,
and laterally by the <b>exoccipitals</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>basi-occipital</b> forms the main part of a prominent
convex knob, the <b>occipital condyle</b>, with which the atlas
articulates. The occipital condyle is slightly notched above,
and the ventral surface of the cranium is deeply pitted just
in front of it; the exoccipitals also contribute slightly to its
formation. Slightly in front of and ventral to the foramen
magnum is a small foramen through which the hypoglossal
nerve leaves the cranial cavity.</p>

<p>The <b>supra-occipital</b> is separated from the parietal by a
suture line along which run a pair of prominent ridges, the
<b>lambdoidal crests</b> (fig. 60, B, 30). There are often a pair of
prominent vacuities in the supra-occipital dorsal to the foramen
magnum. The <b>epi-otics</b> and <b>opisthotics</b> become completely
fused with the bones of the occipital segment at a very early
stage.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The <i>ventral surface</i> of the cranium is wide behind,
where it is formed by a broad transverse membrane bone, the
<i>basitemporal</i> (fig. 60, A, 23), the sides of which are fused with
the auditory capsules. Slightly in front of and an eighth of
an inch external to the hypoglossal foramen the cranial wall is
pierced by a pair of foramina through which the tenth or
pneumogastric nerves leave (fig. 60, A, X). At the sides
of the basitemporal are a pair of depressions, the <b>tympanic
recesses</b>, in each of which are three holes. Straight lines
joining these holes would form an isosceles triangle with its
apex directed forwards. Of the two holes at the base of the
triangle, the one nearer the middle line and leading into the
cranial cavity, is for the exit of the ninth or glossopharyngeal
nerve (fig. 60, A, IX), it lies just in front of the pneumogastric
foramen. The more external leads into the tympanic cavity,
while the more anterior at the apex of the triangle is the
<b>posterior opening of the carotid canal</b> (fig. 60, A, 25),
which traverses the base of the cranium, and during life
lodges the carotid artery.</p>

<p>The anterior end of the basitemporal is pierced near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
middle line by a pair of holes, the <b>anterior openings of the
Eustachian canals</b>; while just in front of these and a little
further removed from the middle line are the anterior openings
of the <b>carotid canals</b>. Bristles passed in through the posterior
openings of the carotid canals will emerge here (fig. 60, A, 27).
In front of the basitemporal the base of the cranium is formed
by the <b>rostrum</b> (fig. 60, A, 31), or thickened basal portion of
the interorbital septum; this bears two prominent surfaces
with which the pterygoids articulate. In some kinds of
duck these surfaces are borne by well-marked basi-pterygoid
processes.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The side of the cranium.</i> At the base of the posterior
end is seen the deep <b>tympanic cavity</b>. The dorsal part of
this is divided by a vertical partition into two halves; of these
the more anterior is the larger, and forms a deep funnel-shaped
cavity, the <b>posterior opening of the Eustachian
canal</b> (fig. 60, B, 26). A bristle passed into this opening
emerges through the anterior opening of the Eustachian canal.
The more posterior of the two is the <b>fenestral recess</b> (fig. 60,
B, 28), and is in its turn divided by a slender horizontal bar
into a dorsal hole, the <b>fenestra ovalis</b>, and a ventral hole,
the <b>fenestra rotunda</b>. During life the fenestra ovalis lodges
the proximal end of the <b>columellar</b> chain. Lying at the
outer side and slightly dorsal to the tympanic cavity is a deep
depression, the <b>lateral tympanic recess</b>, and immediately
in front of this is the articular surface for the quadrate.
The tympanic cavity is bounded below by the basitemporal,
posteriorly by the exoccipital, and above by the <i>squamosal</i>, a
membrane bone, which roofs over a good deal of the side of
the cranium, and bears ventrally a prominent surface with
which the quadrate articulates. Just in front of this is a
large round hole, the <b>trigeminal foramen</b> (fig. 60, B, V),
behind which the squamosal is drawn out into a short process.</p>

<p>In front of the squamosal there is a prominent forwardly-projecting
<b>postfrontal process</b> (fig. 60, 8), which ossifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
from a different centre from that forming the squamosal, but
in the adult is completely fused with it.</p>

<p>The <b>orbit</b> forms a large more or less hemispherical cavity
which lodges the eyeball. It is separated from its fellow of
the opposite side by an imperfect partition, the <b>interorbital
septum</b>. In the young skull it is seen to be bounded above by
the frontal, with which the <i>lachrymal</i> (fig. 60, 7) is fused
anteriorly, forming a large backwardly-projecting process;
while behind it is bounded by the <b>alisphenoid</b>. The interorbital
septum is formed by the ossification and coalescence of
the <b>mesethmoid</b> in front, with the <b>orbitosphenoid</b> behind,
and the <b>rostrum</b> below. The boundary of the orbit below
is very imperfect, the zygomatic arch being incomplete.</p>

<p>The interorbital septum is pierced by the very prominent
<b>optic foramen</b> (fig. 60, B, 2), just behind which are the two
much smaller foramina for the exit of the oculomotor and
pathetic (fig. 60, B, IV) nerves, the more anterior being that
for the oculomotor.</p>

<p>Above and slightly in front of the optic foramen is a
median opening, the <b>olfactory foramen.</b> This leads into
the cranial cavity behind, and in front is continued forwards
as a groove between the interorbital septum and the frontal.</p>


<p>(2) <span class="smcap">The Facial part of the Skull.</span></p>

<p>This includes the olfactory capsule and associated bones,
and the upper jaw.</p>

<p>The bones associated with the olfactory capsules are the
<i>nasals</i> and <i>vomer</i>. The <i>nasals</i> (figs. 59 and 60, 5) lie on the
dorsal surface immediately in front of the cranium, and are
separated from one another by the nasal processes of the premaxillae.
Each is completely fused in the adult with the
corresponding maxillae and premaxillae, the three bones together
forming the boundary of the <b>anterior nares.</b> The <i>vomer</i> (fig.
60, 19) is unpaired and forms a small median vertical plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
lying ventral to the anterior continuation of the interorbital
septum.</p>

<p>The bones of the upper jaw consist on each side of two
slender arcades which in front converge and are attached to
the large beak, while behind they diverge but are united by
the <b>quadrate</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>inner arcade</b> is formed by the pterygoid and palatine.
The <i>pterygoid</i> (fig. 60, 21) is a short flattened bone, which
articulates behind with the quadrate, and on its inner side
with a large flattened surface borne by the rostrum, in front
it meets the palatine, or sometimes ends freely with a long
antero-dorsally directed point.</p>

<p>The <i>palatine</i> (fig. 60, 20) is a slender irregular bone flattened
dorso-ventrally at its anterior end where it articulates
with the beak, and laterally behind. It gives off at its
posterior end a process, which is sometimes united with the
vomer, sometimes projects forwards, and meets its fellow
dorsal to the vomer. In the large space between it and the
vomer is the opening of the <b>posterior nares</b>.</p>

<p>The <i>premaxillae</i> (figs. 59 and 60, 2) are very large, and
form nearly a third of the big shovel-shaped beak. They constitute
the inner, and part of the front boundary of the anterior
nares, and send back a pair of <i>nasal processes</i> which
partially separate the nasals from one another.</p>

<p>The <b>outer arcade</b> forms the slender <b>suborbital bar</b>,
and consists mainly of two rod-like bones, which in the adult
are completely fused together. The posterior of these is the
<i>quadratojugal</i> (figs. 59 and 60, 11) which articulates with the
quadrate, the anterior is the small and slender <i>jugal</i> or <i>malar</i>
(figs. 59 and 60, 10). The extreme anterior part of the bar is
formed by the <i>maxillae</i>. The main part of the maxillae however
lies anterior to the suborbital bar, and extends forwards
along the side of the premaxillae forming all the lateral part of
the beak (figs. 59 and 60, 1); it also sends inwards a plate,
the <b>maxillo-palatine</b> (fig. 60, A, 29), which completely fuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
with its fellow in the middle line, and forms the posterior
boundary of the anterior palatine foramen. The term
<b>desmognathous</b> describes the condition of the skull in
which the maxillo-palatines fuse with one another in the
middle line in this way.</p>

<p>The <b>quadrate</b> (fig. 60, 12), which unites the two arcades
behind, is a stout irregular four-cornered bone forming the
<b>suspensorium</b>. It articulates by its dorso-posterior corner
with the squamosal, and by its antero-internal corner with the
pterygoid. The middle of its ventral surface forms a hemispherical
knob with which the mandible articulates, while its
dorso-anterior border is drawn out into a long point which
extends towards the interorbital septum.</p>


<p>(3) <span class="smcap">The Mandible.</span></p>

<p>The <b>mandible</b> or lower jaw consists of two <b>rami</b> which
are flattened and fused together in the middle line in front,
while behind they diverge from one another and articulate
with the quadrates.</p>

<p>Each ramus is composed of five bones fused together, one
being a cartilage bone, and the other four membrane bones.
The <b>articular</b> is the only cartilage bone of the mandible,
it bears the double condyle (figs. 59 and 60, 13) or concave
articular surface for the quadrate, and is drawn out behind
into a large hooked <b>posterior articular process</b>. The articular
is also drawn out into a prominent process on each
side of the articular surface for the quadrate, and is marked
by a deep pit opening posteriorly. The articular is continuous
in front with <b>Meckel's cartilage</b> which forms the original
cartilaginous bar of the lower jaw, and is ensheathed by the
membrane bones. Of these the <i>supra-angular</i> forms the upper
part of the mandible in front of the articular, its dorsal surface
is drawn out into a small <b>coronoid process</b>, its outer
surface also bearing a prominent process. The <i>angular</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a small bone which underlies the articular and supra-angular
on the inner side of the jaw. The <i>dentary</i> (fig. 59, 15) forms
the anterior half of each ramus, and is the largest bone of the
mandible; it is fused with its fellow at the symphysis in front,
and extends back below the supra-angular. The <i>splenial</i> is a
small bone lying along the middle half of the inner side of
each ramus of the mandible.</p>


<p>(4) <span class="smcap">The Hyoid.</span></p>

<p>With the hyoid apparatus is included the <b>columella</b>.
This forms a minute rod of bone, one end of which is expanded
and fits into the fenestra ovalis, while the other end,
terminated by a triradiate piece of cartilage, is attached
to the tympanic membrane. The structure is as a whole
homologous with the auditory ossicles of mammals and the
hyomandibular of fish.</p>

<p>The <b>hyoid</b> consists of a median unpaired portion, formed
of two pieces of bone, the <b>basi-hyal</b> (fig. 59, C, 16) in front,
and the <b>uro-hyal</b> (fig. 59, C, 17) behind, the two being placed
end to end and terminated anteriorly by an unpaired cartilaginous
plate, the <b>os entoglossum.</b> At the posterior end
there come off a pair of long <b>posterior cornua</b>, each of
which consists of two pieces, a longer <b>basibranchial</b> (fig. 59,
C, 18), and a shorter <b>cerato-branchial</b>. For the homology of
these parts see p. 336.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Ribs and Sternum.</span></p>

<p>The last two cervical vertebrae bear long movable ribs
which articulate by distinct capitular and tubercular processes,
but do not meet the sternum. The thoracic ribs are eight in
number, and each is divisible into a <b>vertebral</b> and a <b>sternal</b>
portion. The first five thoracic ribs are flattened curved bars
of bone, which articulate by a prominent <b>capitulum</b> with
the centrum of the corresponding vertebra, and by a <b>tuberculum</b>
with the transverse process. Projecting backwards
from each is a large hooked <b>uncinate process.</b> The last three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
ribs which are without uncinate processes, become progressively
more slender, and in the eighth the tubercular processes are lost.</p>

<p>The sternal portions of the ribs are imperfectly ossified
pieces, short and comparatively thick in the case of the anterior
ribs, longer and more slender in the case of the posterior ribs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sternum</span>[1].</p>

<p>The <b>sternum</b> or breast bone is exceedingly large in the
Duck, as in all birds, and projects back far beyond the thorax over
much of the anterior part of the abdomen. It is an irregularly
oblong plate of bone, abruptly truncated behind, somewhat
concave dorsally, and drawn out ventrally into a prominent keel,
the <b>carina</b>, which projects for some distance forwards beyond
the body of the sternum, and tapers off gradually behind.
The point where the carina joins the body of the sternum is at
the anterior end drawn out into a small process, the <b>rostrum</b><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.
Just dorsolateral to this are a pair of deep grooves, the
<b>coracoid grooves</b>, with which the coracoids articulate.</p>

<p>The sides of the sternum are drawn out in front into a
pair of short blunt <b>costal processes;</b> and just behind these
are a series of seven surfaces with which the ends of the
sternal ribs articulate. Immediately behind these surfaces
the sides are produced into a pair of long backwardly-projecting
<b>xiphoid processes</b> which nearly meet processes from
the posterior end of the sternum.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This consists of the skeleton of the anterior and posterior
limbs and of their respective girdles.</p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Pectoral Girdle</span><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<p>The pectoral girdle in almost all birds is strongly constructed
and firmly united to the sternum. It consists of three bones,
a dorsal element, the <b>scapula</b>, a posterior ventral element, the
<b>coracoid</b>, and an anterior ventral element, the <i>clavicle</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>scapula</b> forms a long curved flattened bone expanded
at its anterior end, where it meets the coracoid, and lying
across the ribs at its tapering posterior end. It helps to form
the imperfect <b>glenoid cavity</b>, with which the humerus articulates.
The <b>coracoid</b>, a shorter but stouter bone than the
scapula, has its upper end or <b>head</b> thickened and bears on its
posterior border an irregular surface, with part of which the
scapula articulates, while the rest forms part of the glenoid
cavity. The inner border of the coracoid adjoining the articular
facet for the scapula is produced into a strong process
which helps to complete the <b>foramen triosseum</b>, a space
lying between the adjoining ends of the scapula and coracoid,
through which the tendon of the second pectoral muscle passes.
The lower part of the coracoid, which is much flattened and
expanded, and abruptly truncated posteriorly, articulates
with the coracoid groove of the sternum. The <i>clavicle</i> is a
thickened curved membrane bone, which is fused with its
fellow in the middle line below, the two forming the <i>furcula</i>
or merrythought. Its dorsal end is drawn out into a process
which articulates with the coracoid.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Anterior Limb or Wing.</span></p>

<p>This consists of three parts, a proximal part, the upper arm
or <b>brachium</b>, a middle part, the fore-arm or <b>antibrachium</b>,
and a distal part, the <b>manus</b>. When extended for flight the
parts lie almost in the same straight line, but when at rest they
are folded on one another in the form of a Z, the brachium and
manus pointing backwards, and the antibrachium forwards.
When extended for flight the surfaces and borders of the wing
correspond in position with those of the primitive vertebrate
limb<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>, the pre-axial border being directed forwards and the postaxial
backwards, while the dorsal and ventral surfaces look
respectively upwards and downwards. But when the wing is
at rest, the humerus as it extends backwards becomes slightly
rotated, so that its dorsal surface looks more inwards than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
upwards, while the dorsal surface of the antibrachium looks
partially outwards and upwards, and that of the manus mainly
outwards.</p>

<p>The <b>brachium</b> or <b>upper arm</b> contains only a single bone,
the <b>humerus</b> (fig. 57, 1). This is a large nearly straight bone
expanded at both ends. The proximal end is specially expanded,
forming two <b>tuberosities</b>, and a large convex <b>head</b>
articulating with the glenoid cavity. The <b>pre-axial tuberosity</b>
is the smaller of the two, but is continued by a
prominent <b>deltoid ridge</b>, which extends for a very short
distance down the shaft. The <b>postaxial tuberosity</b> is the
larger, and below it there is a very deep pit, the <b>pneumatic
foramen</b>, which leads into an air cavity in the shaft of the
bone. The shaft is long and straight, and at the distal end
of the bone is the <b>trochlea</b> with two convex surfaces, one
pre-axial with which the radius articulates, the other postaxial
for the ulna.</p>

<p>The <b>fore-arm</b> or <b>antibrachium</b> consists of two bones,
the <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b>. These are of nearly equal length, and
are separated from one another by a considerable space except
at their terminations.</p>

<p>The <b>radius</b> (fig. 57, 2), the pre-axial and smaller bone, is
straight and fairly stout; its proximal end articulates with
the humerus by a slightly cupped surface, while its distal end,
which articulates with the carpus, is convex and somewhat
expanded.</p>

<p>The <b>ulna</b> (fig. 57, 3) is longer, stouter, and slightly curved.
Its proximal end is expanded, forming two surfaces which
articulate with the trochlea of the humerus; behind them it
is drawn out into a short blunt <b>olecranon process</b>. Its
distal end is less expanded, and articulates with the carpus
and also with the radius.</p>

<p>The <b>Manus</b>. This includes the carpus or wrist, and the
hand.</p>

<p>The <b>Carpus</b>. While in the embryo the carpus consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of five distinct elements arranged in a proximal row of two
and a distal row of three, in the adult only the proximal
bones can be clearly distinguished, the distal ones having
become completely ankylosed with the metacarpals to form
the <b>carpo-metacarpus</b>.</p>

<p>The two distinct carpal bones are the radial carpal and
the ulnar carpal. The radial carpal (fig. 57, 4) is a small
somewhat cubical bone, wedged in between the manus and
the radius and ulna. The ulnar carpal (fig. 57, 5) is a
somewhat larger, more irregular bone, lying adjacent to the
end of the ulna. It is deeply notched to receive the carpo-metacarpus.</p>

<p><b>The hand.</b> In the adult bird the hand is in a much
modified condition; only the first three digits are represented,
and the metacarpals are all fused with one another and with
the distal carpalia to form the <b>carpo-metacarpus</b>.</p>

<p>The most prominent part of the carpo-metacarpus is formed
by the <b>second metacarpal</b> (fig. 57, 7), a stout, straight bone
expanded at both ends. The <b>third metacarpal</b> (fig. 57, 8)
is a more slender curved bone fused at both ends with the
second metacarpal. The <b>first metacarpal</b> forms simply a
small projection on the radial side of the proximal end of the
second metacarpal.</p>

<p>The <b>phalanges</b>. The first digit or <b>pollex</b> includes two
phalanges, the distal one being very small and bearing a claw.</p>

<p>The second digit includes three phalanges, the proximal
one being somewhat flattened. The third digit has a single
small phalanx.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The bones constituting the pelvic girdle are not only as in
other higher vertebrates ankylosed together forming the innominate
bones, but are also ankylosed with a series of some
seventeen sacral and pseudosacral vertebrae. The <b>acetabulum</b>
(fig. 61, 5) with which the head of the femur articulates is
incompletely ossified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>ilium</b> (figs. 58 and 61, 1) is the largest bone of the
pelvis. It forms a long flattened plate extending for a considerable
distance both in front of and behind the acetabulum,
and is fused along its whole length with the transverse processes
and neural spines of the sacral and pseudosacral vertebrae.
It forms more than half the acetabulum, above and
behind which it is produced to form a process, the <b>antitrochanter</b>
(fig 61, 8), with which the great trochanter of the
femur articulates.</p>

<p>The <b>ischium</b> (figs. 58 and 61, 2) is a flattened bone which
forms about one-third of the acetabulum, and lies ventral to the
posterior part of the ilium. Its anterior portion is separated
from the ilium by the large oval <b>ilio-sciatic foramen</b> (fig.
61, 6), while behind this the two bones are completely fused.</p>

<p>The <b>pubis</b> (figs. 58 and 61, 3) is a very long slender bar
of bone which forms only a very small part of the acetabulum
and runs back parallel to the ventral surface of the ischium
with which it is loosely connected at its posterior end. For
the greater part of their length the two bones are separated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the long narrow <b>obturator foramen</b>. Behind the ischium
the pubis is produced into a long curved downwardly-projecting
process, and in front of the acetabulum it bears a short
blunt <b>pectineal</b> or <b>pre-pubic process</b> (fig. 61, 4) probably
homologous with the pre-pubis of Orthopod Dinosaurs. The
remainder of the pubis is homologous with the post-pubis of
Orthopod Dinosaurs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Posterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>The leg of the bird is somewhat differently constructed from
that of other vertebrates owing to the fact that there is no
free tarsus, the proximal tarsals having fused with the tibia,
and the distal with the metatarsals.</p>

<p>The <b>thigh</b> consists of a single bone, the femur. The <b>femur</b>
is a comparatively short bone with a straight shaft and expanded
ends. The proximal end bears on its inner side a
rounded <b>head</b>, which articulates with the acetabulum. On its
outer side is an irregular outgrowth, the <b>great trochanter</b>,
while between the two is the surface which meets the antitrochanter
of the ilium. The posterior end also is expanded
and marked by a wide groove which lodges the <b>patella</b>. On
each side of the groove is a strong <b>condylar ridge</b> for articulation
with the tibia. The external condyle is deeply grooved
behind for articulation with the fibula.</p>

<p>The <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b> consists of two separate bones, (1) the
<b>tibio-tarsus</b>, formed by the fusion of the tibia with the proximal
row of tarsals, and (2) the <b>fibula</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>tibio-tarsus</b> is a thick straight bone nearly twice as
long as the femur. Both ends of the bone are considerably
expanded. The proximal end bears two slight depressions
which articulate with the condyles of the femur, and a third
depression which partly lodges the patella. The proximal end
of the anterior or extensor surface is drawn out into a very
prominent <b>cnemial crest</b> which bends over towards the postaxial
side of the bone; a slight ridge is continued from it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the way down the shaft. The proximal part of the shaft of
the tibio-tarsus bears a roughened ridge with which the fibula
is closely connected. The distal end is expanded and rotated
outwardly and forms a prominent pulley-like surface which
articulates with the tarso-metatarsus.</p>

<p>The <b>fibula</b> is reduced to the proximal portion only, which
is expanded and articulates with a depression behind the
external condyle of the femur. The fibula further extends
about a third of the way down the shaft of the tibio-tarsus.
The <b>patella</b> or <b>knee-cap</b> is a sesamoid bone due to an ossification
in the tendon of the extensor muscles of the leg.</p>

<p>The <b>ankle joint</b> lies between the proximal and distal
tarsals which as previously mentioned fuse respectively with
the tibia and metatarsus.</p>

<p>The <b>Pes</b>. The pes includes four digits, and consists of the
tarso-metatarsus and the phalanges. The proximal tarsals
which are fused with the tibia also really belong to the pes.</p>

<p>The <b>tarso-metatarsus</b> is a strong straight bone nearly as
long as the femur, and is formed by the fusion of the distal
tarsals with the second, third and fourth metatarsals. The
proximal end of the bone is expanded and bears two facets for
articulation with the tibio-tarsus, and near them on the posterior
surface is a large roughened projection. The lines of
junction between the several metatarsals are marked along
the shaft by slight ridges. At the distal end of the bone the
three metatarsals diverge from one another and each bears a
prominent convex pulley-like surface. The <b>first metatarsal</b>
is reduced to the distal end, which tapers to a point proximally,
and is attached by ligaments near the distal end of the tarso-metatarsus.</p>

<p>The <b>digits</b>. Four digits are present, each consisting of a
metatarsal (already described) and a certain number of phalanges,
the terminal one being in each case clawed. The first
digit or <b>hallux</b> has two phalanges, the second three, the third
four, and the fourth five.</p>

<small>GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN BIRDS.</small></h2>


<p>EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The epidermal exoskeleton of birds is very greatly developed,
feathers constituting its most important part.</p>

<p>Three kinds of feathers are found, viz. (<i>a</i>) <i>pennae</i> including
quills and coverts, (<i>b</i>) down feathers or <i>plumulae</i>, and (<i>c</i>) <i>filoplumes</i>
which are rudimentary feathers. The structure of
the different kinds of feathers is described on pp. 303-306.</p>

<p>Sometimes a fourth class of feathers, the <i>semiplumae</i>, is
recognised. They have the stems of pennae, and the downy
barbs and barbules of plumulae.</p>

<p>In most birds the pennae are not uniformly distributed
over the whole surface of the body, but are confined to certain
tracts, the <b>pterylae</b>; while the intervening spaces or <b>apteria</b>
are either bare or covered only with down feathers. In some
birds, however, such as the Ratitae and the Penguins, pennae
are evenly distributed over the whole body.</p>

<p>In many birds the calamus or quill bears two vexilla or
vanes, the second of which, called the <b>aftershaft</b> or <b>hyporachis</b>,
is generally much the smaller, and is attached to the
under surface of the main vexillum. In the Moas, Emeu and
Cassowary the two vexilla in the adult bird are nearly equal
in size; though in the nestling Emeu one is much longer than
the other. The aftershaft is very small in most Passeres and
gallinaceous birds, but is comparatively large in Parrots, Gulls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Herons and most birds of prey. It is absent or extremely
small in the Ostrich, <i>Apteryx</i>, <i>Rhea</i>, Pigeons, Owls, Anseres,
and others.</p>

<p>The quill feathers include two groups, the <b>remiges</b> or
wing quills, and the <b>rectrices</b> or tail quills. In most birds
the primary remiges, or those which are attached to the bones
of the manus, are ten or eleven in number, and are set in
grooves in the bones, being firmly attached to them. In the
Ostrich however the primaries are little specialised in character
and are as many as sixteen in number. They are also less
definitely attached to the bones; as their ends do not lie in
grooves in the bones, but project beyond them.</p>

<p>The secondary quills or those attached to the ulna vary
much in number according to the length of the bone. The
large dark quills in the wings of Cassowaries are the secondaries.</p>

<p>The wing of Penguins is very little differentiated. It
is covered at the margin by overlapping scales which gradually
merge into scale-like feathers at the proximal end. The wing
of the Penguin has nothing comparable to the remiges of other
birds.</p>

<p>In some birds, such as Herons (<i>Ardea</i>), there occur in
places plumulae of a peculiar kind, which grow persistently
and whose summits break off into fine powder as fast as they
are formed. These feathers are known as <i>powder-down</i>
feathers. They occur also in some Parrots and are then
scattered indiscriminately all over the body.</p>

<p>Other exoskeletal structures besides feathers are commonly
well developed. Thus the extremities of the jaws are sheathed
in horny <b>beaks</b> whose form varies enormously according to
the special mode of life.</p>

<p>In ducks and geese the beak with the exception of the
anterior end is soft, and its edges are raised into lamellae,
while in the Mergansers these lamellae become pointed processes
supported by bony outgrowths. These lamellae act as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
strainers. In Parrots and Hawks, on the other hand, nearly
the whole of the beak is hard.</p>

<p>The toes and tarso-metatarsus are usually featherless and
are covered either with granular structures or with well-formed
scales. The toes are nearly always provided with
<b>claws</b>, and these vary in correlation with the character of the
beak. Claws<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> also sometimes occur on the manus. Thus
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and some Ostriches and Rheas have claws on
all three digits. Most Ostriches and Rheas, and many Anseres
and birds of prey, have them on the first two digits, while the
Secretary bird (<i>Gypogeranus</i>) and many fowls, ducks, and birds
of prey, especially kestrels, have a claw only on the pollex.
In the Cassowary, Emeu, Apteryx and some Ostriches and
Rheas only the second digit is clawed.</p>

<p>Claws should not be confounded with <b>spurs</b>, which are
conical horny structures developed on bony outgrowths of
the radial side of the carpus, metacarpus, or metatarsus.
They occur in a number of birds, but are most commonly
developed in gallinaceous birds, by which they are used for
fighting. A single spur occurs on the metacarpus in <i>Megapodius</i>,
in <i>Palamedea</i>, in <i>Parra jacana</i> and in <i>Hoplopterus
spinosus</i>, the Spur-winged plover. The Derbian Screamer,
<i>Chauna derbiana</i>, has two metacarpal spurs, borne on the
first and second metacarpals. The Spur-winged goose, <i>Plectropterus
gambensis</i>, has a carpal spur borne on the radial
carpal. Metatarsal spurs are quite common.</p>

<p>The male Solitaire (<i>Pezophaps</i>) has large bony excrescences
on the wrist which may, like spurs, have been sheathed in
horn and used for fighting.</p>

<p><b>Teeth</b> do not occur in any living birds, but conical teeth
imbedded in separate sockets are present in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and <i>Ichthyornis</i>, while in <i>Hesperornis</i> similar teeth occur implanted
in continuous grooves in the mandibles and maxillae,
the premaxillae being toothless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Except that teeth are partly dermal in origin, a dermal
exoskeleton is quite unrepresented in birds.</p>


<p>ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the endoskeleton of
birds is its pneumaticity. In the embryo all the bones contain
marrow, but as growth proceeds this becomes replaced by
air to a variable extent in different forms. In all birds some
part of the skeleton is pneumatic. Many small birds and
<i>Apteryx</i> and Penguins among larger ones have air only in the
skull; in Pigeons air is present in all the bones except the
caudal vertebrae, the leg bones, and those of the antibrachium
and manus; in Hornbills every bone contains air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vertebral Column.</span></p>

<p>The vertebral column of birds is readily divisible into a
very mobile cervical region, and an extremely rigid post-cervical
region. In most birds the vertebral centra are without
terminal epiphyses, but these structures are found in
Parrots. The cervical vertebrae are generally large and vary
in number from eight or nine to twenty-three in Swans.
Except in some extinct forms, such as <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Apatornis</i>,
in which they are biconcave, the centra are characterised
by having saddle-shaped articulating surfaces, which
in front are concave from side to side and slightly convex
from above downwards, while posteriorly they are convex
from side to side and concave from above downwards. The
atlas is small and ring-like, and its centrum is fused with the
axis forming the odontoid process. Cervical ribs are often
well developed, and in some of the Ratitae they remain for a
long time distinct from the vertebrae.</p>

<p>The thoracic vertebrae are distinguished from the cervical
by the fact that their true ribs are united to the sternum
by means of sternal ribs. This distinction, however, though
convenient, is somewhat arbitrary, as it has been shown that
in the fowl and gannet, two pairs of ribs which in the adult
are free from the sternum, are connected with it in the embryo.
When, as in the Swans, the thoracic vertebrae are
not all fused together, they generally have saddle-shaped
articulating surfaces, but sometimes, as in the Penguins, Auks
and Plovers, the centra are convex in front and concave behind.
The trunk vertebrae generally have well-marked neural
spines, while in the Divers the anterior ones have peculiar
bifurcating hypapophyses.</p>

<p>The trunk vertebrae are not readily divisible into thoracic
and lumbar. There are two true sacral vertebrae, but as
development proceeds a number of other vertebrae become
fused with the true sacrals, the whole forming a large compound
sacrum. These pseudosacral vertebrae generally include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebrae.
Sixteen to twenty vertebrae or even more may be included
in the compound sacrum, and sometimes the whole of the
trunk vertebrae are fused together. In <i>Archaeopteryx</i> however
but five vertebrae take part in the formation of the sacrum.</p>

<p>In <i>Archaeopteryx</i> there are twenty long caudal vertebrae,
of which the last sixteen carry a pair of feathers apiece, but
in all other birds the tail is short and in the great majority
of cases the posterior vertebrae are fused together, forming the
pygostyle. In the Ratitae and Tinamidae a pygostyle is rarely
or imperfectly developed. In <i>Hesperornis</i> there are twelve
caudal vertebrae, six or seven of which are united by their
centra only, forming an imperfect pygostyle.</p>

<p>The free caudal vertebrae are generally amphicoelous.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>The skull of all birds from <i>Archaeopteryx</i> onwards is
essentially similar, differing from the skull of reptiles mainly
in the extent to which the cranium is arched, and its greater
size in proportion to the jaws.</p>

<p>Most of the bones of the cranium are pneumatic, and all
show a marked tendency to fuse together, and have their
outlines obliterated by the disappearance of the sutures. The
several bones remain longest distinguishable in the Ratitae
and to a less extent in the Penguins. The orbits are very
large and lie almost entirely in front of the cranium; they
are separated by an interorbital septum which is sometimes, as
in <i>Chauna</i> and <i>Scythrops</i>, very complete, sometimes, as in
Hornbills and the Common Heron, very slightly developed.
As a general rule the sclerotic is cartilaginous.</p>

<p>The anterior nares are almost always situated far back
at the base of the beak near the orbits, but in <i>Apteryx</i> they
are placed right at its extremity. In <i>Phororhacos</i> they are
placed very high up on the enormous beak and are not separated
by any bony partition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The skull of Parrots has some peculiarities. In some
Parrots the lachrymal sends back a process which meets the
postorbital process of the frontal and completes the orbit.
In most birds the upper beak is immovably fixed, but in
some it is attached to the cranium, only by the nasals and
by flexible processes of the premaxillae, so that by this
means a kind of elastic joint is established and the beak is able
to be moved on the cranium. In the Parrots and <i>Opisthocomus</i>
there is a regular highly movable joint.</p>

<p>In Cassowaries the fronto-nasal region of the skull is produced
into an enormous bony crest, and in Hornbills a
somewhat similar structure occurs. Although true teeth do
not occur in any known bird except <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i>,
and <i>Ichthyornis</i>, another extinct bird, <i>Odontopteryx</i>, has
the margins of both jaws provided with forwardly-directed
tooth-like serrations, formed of part of the actual jawbone: a
living hawk, <i>Harpagus</i>, too, has a deeply notched bill, to
which correspond serrations in the premaxillae.</p>

<p>A basi-pterygoid process of the basisphenoid abuts against
the pterygoid in Ratitae and in Tinamous, plovers, fowls,
pigeons, ducks and geese among Carinatae, recalling the
arrangement met with in many reptiles. The squamosal is
sometimes, as in the fowl, united with the postorbital process
of the frontal. In the Carinatae the quadrate articulates
with the cranium by a double convex surface, in the Ratitae
by a single one. The premaxillae are always comparatively
large bones, the maxillae on the contrary are small, but
give rise to important inwardly-projecting maxillo-palatine
processes.</p>

<p>The relations of the palatines, pterygoids, maxillae, and
vomers vary considerably, and on them Huxley has based a
classification of birds<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. In the Ratitae and the Tinamous
(Tinamidae), among Carinatae the vomers unite and form a
large broad bone, separating the palatines and the pterygoids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
from the rostrum. Huxley uses the term <b>Dromaeognathous</b>
to describe this condition. In all other Carinatae the vomers
are narrow behind, and the palatines and pterygoids converge
posteriorly and articulate largely with the rostrum. Three
modifications of this condition are distinguished by Huxley, and
termed <b>Schizognathous</b>, <b>&AElig;githognathous</b>, and <b>Desmognathous</b>.</p>

<p>In the <b>Schizognathae</b> the vomers coalesce and form a
narrow elongated bone, pointed in front, separating the
maxillo-palatine processes of the premaxillae. Waders, fowls,
penguins, gulls, some falcons and eagles, American vultures,
some herons and many owls have the Schizognathous arrangement.
In pigeons and sandgrouse there is no vomer, but the
other bones have the Schizognathous arrangement.</p>

<p>In the <b>&AElig;githognathae</b> the arrangement is the same as in
the Schizognathae, except that the vomers are truncated in
front. Passeres, swifts, woodpeckers, humming birds, rollers,
hoopoes have this arrangement.</p>

<p>In the <b>Desmognathae</b> (fig. 60, A) the maxillo-palatine
processes approach one another in the middle line, and either
unite with the vomers, or unite with one another, hiding the
vomers. Thus a more or less complete bony roof is formed
across the palate. The vomers in Desmognathae are small or
sometimes absent. Ducks, storks, most herons, most birds of
prey and owls, pelicans, cormorants, parrots, and flamingoes
are Desmognathous.</p>

<p>The mandible, as in other Sauropsids, consists of a cartilage
bone, the articular, and a series of membrane bones, the
dentary, splenial, coronoid, angular, and supra-angular, developed
round the unossified Meckel's cartilage. The dentaries
of the two rami are nearly always fused together, but in
<i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> the two rami are but loosely
united. There is often a fontanelle between the dentary and
the posterior bones, while the angle is sometimes, as in the
fowl, drawn out into a long curved process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>The hyoid apparatus (fig. 59, C) consists of a median
portion, and a pair of cornua. The median portion is composed
of three pieces placed end to end, and called respectively
the os entoglossum, the basi-hyal, and the uro-hyal. The os
entoglossum is shown by development to be formed by the
union of paired structures and is probably homologous with the
hyoid arch of fishes. The basi-hyal and the long cornua, each
of which is composed of two or three pieces placed end to end,
are homologous with the first branchial arch of fishes, while
the uro-hyal is probably homologous with the second branchial
arch of fishes. In Woodpeckers the cornua are enormously
long, and curve over the skull, extending as far forwards as
the anterior nares.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ribs and Sternum.</span></p>

<p>Well-developed ribs are attached to the posterior cervical
vertebrae as well as to the thoracic vertebrae. The ribs
generally have uncinate processes and separate capitula and
tubercula, but uncinate processes are absent in <i>Chauna Palamedea</i>
and apparently in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.</p>

<p>The sternum (fig. 63) is greatly developed in all birds. In
the embryo<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> it is seen to be derived from the union of right
and left plates of cartilage, formed by the fusion of the ventral
ends of the ribs. In the Ratitae and a few Carinatae, such
as <i>Stringops</i>, it is flat, but in the great majority of birds
it is keeled, though the development of the keel varies greatly.
It is large in the flightless Penguins, which use their wings
for swimming. Traces of an interclavicle may occur in the
embryo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pectoral Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pectoral girdle is also strongly developed in all
Carinatae, but is much reduced in Ratitae. In some Moas
the sternum has no facet for the articulation of the coracoid,
and the pectoral girdle appears to have been entirely absent;
it is extremely small also in <i>Apteryx</i>. Clavicles are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
well developed in the Carinatae, and small ones are found
also in <i>Hesperornis</i>, and in Emeus and Cassowaries. In the
other living Ratitae and in <i>Stringops</i> they are absent. In
some Parrots, Owls and Toucans they do not meet one another
ventrally. Clavicles are especially stout in some of the birds
of prey. They do not generally touch the sternum, but sometimes,
as in the Pelican (fig. 63, C), Adjutant and Frigate bird,
they are fused with it.</p>

<p>In all Ratitae the scapula and coracoid lie almost in the
same straight line with one another, in the Carinatae they are
nearly at right angles to one another.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Anterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>In the wing of nearly all birds the ulna is thicker than the
radius, but in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> the two bones are equal in size.
In the wing of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> there are three long digits with
distinct metacarpals. In all other birds the digits are modified,
the metacarpals being commonly fused and the phalanges
reduced in number. In <i>Palamedea</i> and some other birds the
metacarpus bears a bony outgrowth, which when sheathed in
horn forms a spur.</p>

<p>In most of the Ratitae and in the extinct Dodo (<i>Didus</i>)
and Solitaire (<i>Pezophaps</i>) the wing is very small, but the
usual parts are recognisable. In <i>Hesperornis</i> apparently only
the humerus is present; in some Moas, in which the wing is
imperfectly known, the presence of the humerus is indicated
by traces of a glenoid cavity. In most Moas the wing is
apparently completely absent. As compared with those in other
Ratitae, the wings of the Ostrich and Rhea are well developed.
In the Ostrich (fig. 64, B) and Rhea, as in nearly all Carinatae,
the manus has three digits, but in <i>Apteryx</i> there is only a single
digit, the second. The Penguins (fig. 64, A) too among Carinatae
have only two digits, but in their case it is the pollex
which is missing. In the Ostrich the third digit has two
phalanges, in all other living birds it has only one phalanx.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>Birds have a very large pelvis and its characters are
constant throughout almost the whole group. The ilium
is very large, and is united along its whole length with
the sacral and pseudosacral vertebrae. The ischium is broad
and extends back parallel to the ilium with which in most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
birds it fuses posteriorly, further forward the ilio-sciatic
foramen separates the two bones. In <i>Tinamus</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i>,
<i>Apteryx</i> (fig. 65, B, 2), and <i>Struthio</i>, the ischia are separate
from the ilia along their whole length except at the acetabulum;
in <i>Phororhacos</i>, on the other hand, the two bones are
fused along almost their whole length. The bone usually
called the pubis in birds corresponds to the post-pubis of
Dinosaurs and forms a long slender rod (fig. 65, 3) lying
parallel to the ischium. In many birds the ischia and pubes
are united at their distal ends. This is the case in the Ostrich
(fig. 65, D), in which the ilia and ischia are widely separated.
In many birds the pubis is drawn out in front into the pectineal
process, this is specially large in <i>Apteryx</i> (fig. 65, B, 5), and in
the embryos of many birds. It is probably homologous with the
pre-pubis of Dinosaurs but in some birds is formed in part by
the ilium. The acetabulum in birds is always perforate.</p>

<p>In <i>Rhea</i> (fig. 65, C, 2) and probably in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> a
symphysis ischii occurs, and in the ostrich alone among birds
there is a symphysis pubis. In <i>Archaeopteryx</i> all three bones
of the pelvis are distinct, but they are imperfectly known. In
Ichthyornis they are also distinct, in all other known birds
they are fused together to a greater or less extent.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Posterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>The tibia is always well developed and has a very strong
cnemial crest. The proximal tarsals are fused with its
distal end, the whole forming a compound bone, the tibio-tarsus.
There is frequently an oblique bar of bone crossing
the anterior face of the tibio-tarsus at the distal end, just
above the articular surface of the tarso-metatarsus, this is
absent in Ostriches and <i>&AElig;pyornis</i>. The fibula though in the
embryo and in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> equal in length to the tibia, is in
the adult of other birds always imperfect, its proximal end
is often fused with the tibia, and its distal end is commonly
atrophied. In the Penguins however the distal end is complete.
The distal tarsals fuse with the second, third and fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
metatarsals, forming a compound bone, the tarso-metatarsus.
The first metatarsal is nearly always free but occasionally
as in <i>Phaëthon</i> it is fused with the others. No adult bird
has more than four digits in the pes. In the Penguins the
metatarsals are separate, and in many birds larger or smaller
gaps exist between the fused metatarsals. In most birds
the third metatarsal is curved so as not to lie in the same
plane as the others, but in the Penguins they all three lie in
the same plane. The metatarsals are clearly separated in
<i>Archaeopteryx</i>. In Gallinaceous birds the tarso-metatarsus
bears a bony outgrowth which is sheathed in horn and forms
a spur.</p>

<p>In most birds the first four toes are present while the fifth
is always absent. The first toe commonly has two phalanges,
the second three, the third four, and the fourth five. In
Swifts the third and fourth toes have only three phalanges.
Many birds, such as all Ratitae except <i>Apteryx</i>, have only three
toes, the hallux being absent; in the Ostrich the second toe is
also gone with the exception of a small metatarsal, so that the
foot retains only the third and fourth digits, the third being
much the larger of the two and bearing a claw, while the
fourth is clawless.</p>

<p>In the Swifts, Cormorants, and Penguins, all four toes are
directed forwards. In most birds the hallux is directed backwards,
and the other toes forwards. In the Owls the fourth
toe can be directed backwards as well as the hallux, while
in Parrots, Cuckoos, Woodpeckers, and Toucans the fourth toe
is permanently reversed. In Trogons the second toe is reversed
in addition to the hallux, but not the fourth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>CLASS MAMMALIA.</small></h2>


<p>The skeleton of the members of this class, the highest of
the vertebrata, has the following characteristics:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some part of the integument at some period of life is
always provided with hairs; these are epidermal structures
arising from short papillae of the Malpighian layer of the
epidermis, which at once grow inwards and become imbedded
in pits of the dermis. Sometimes scales or spines occur, and
epidermal exoskeletal structures in the form of hoofs, nails,
claws and horns are also characteristic. As regards the endoskeleton,
the vertebral centra have terminal epiphyses except
in the Ornithodelphia and some Sirenia. In the skull the
cranial region is greatly developed as compared with that in
lower vertebrates, and whereas in many reptiles the true
cranium is largely concealed by a false roof, in mammals the
only relic of this secondary roof is found in the zygomatic
arch, and postorbital bar. In the adult all the bones except
the mandible, hyoid, and auditory ossicles are firmly united
together. The basisphenoid is well ossified, and there is no
parasphenoid. The pro-otic ossifies, and unites with the epi-otic
and opisthotic before they coalesce with any other bones.</p>

<p>The skull articulates with the vertebral column by means
of two convex occipital condyles formed mainly by the exoccipitals,
and the mandible articulates with the squamosal
without the intervention of the quadrate. The latter is much
reduced, and is converted into the tympanic ring, while the
hyomandibular of fish is represented by the auditory ossicles<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>The teeth are always attached to the maxillae, premaxillae
and mandibles, never to any of the other bones. They are
nearly always implanted in distinct sockets, and are hardly ever
ankylosed to the bone. The teeth of mammals are generally
markedly heterodont, four forms, incisors, canines, premolars,
and molars, being commonly distinguishable. Some mammals
are <i>monophyodont</i>, having only a single set of teeth, but the
great majority are <i>diphyodont</i>, having two sets, a deciduous or
milk dentition, and a permanent dentition.</p>

<p>The <i>incisors</i>, the front teeth, are simple, one-rooted, adapted
for cutting, and are nearly always borne by the premaxillae.
Next come the <i>canines</i>, one on each side in each jaw. They are
generally large teeth adapted for tearing or holding, and get
their name from the fact that they are largely developed in the
dog. The remaining teeth form the grinding series, the more
posterior of them being the <i>molars</i>, which are not preceded by
milk teeth<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. Between the molars and the canines are the <i>premolars</i>,
which do as a rule have milk or deciduous predecessors,
though very frequently the first of them is without a milk
predecessor.</p>

<p>In describing the dentition of any mammal, for the sake of
brevity a formula is generally made use of. Thus, the typical
mammalian dentition is expressed by the formula</p>

<p class="cen"><span style="font-size:large;"><i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> = <sup>11</sup>/<sub>11</sub>,</span></p>

<p class="noin">giving twenty-two teeth on each side, or forty-four altogether<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.
The incisors are represented by <i>i</i>, the canines by <i>c</i>, the premolars
by <i>p</i> or <i>pm</i>, and the molars by <i>m</i>. The numbers above
the lines represent the teeth in the upper jaw, those below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>the lines the teeth in the lower jaw. The milk dentition is
expressed by a similar formula with <i>d</i> (deciduous) prefixed to
the letter expressing the nature of the tooth.</p>

<p>The following terms are of frequent use as characterising
certain forms of the grinding surfaces of teeth, and it will be
well to define them at once.</p>

<p><i>Bunodont</i> is a term applied to teeth with broad crowns
raised into rounded tubercles, e.g. the grinding teeth of Pigs
and Hippopotami;</p>

<p><i>Bilophodont</i> to teeth marked by a simple pair of transverse
ridges, with or without a third ridge running along the
outer border of the tooth at right angles to the other two,
e.g. the grinding teeth of <i>Lophiodon</i>, Kangaroo, Manatee,
Tapir, <i>Dinotherium</i>;</p>

<p><i>Selenodont</i> to teeth marked by crescentic ridges running
from the anterior towards the posterior end of the tooth, e.g.
the grinding teeth of the Ox and Sheep.</p>

<p>Teeth whose crowns are low so that their whole structure
is visible from the grinding surface are called <i>brachydont</i>, while
those with higher crowns, in which the bases of the infoldings
of enamel are invisible from the grinding surface are said to
be <i>hypsodont</i>. Bunodont teeth are brachydont, the teeth of the
Horse and Ox are hypsodont.</p>

<p>Passing now to the appendicular skeleton&mdash;the shoulder
girdle differs markedly from that of Sauropsids in the fact that
the coracoid, except in the Ornithodelphia, is greatly reduced,
generally forming only a small process on the scapula. In the
pelvis the pubes meet in a ventral symphysis, except in some
Insectivora and Chiroptera. In many mammals a fourth pelvic
element, the <i>acetabular bone</i>, is distinguishable. The ankle
joint is <i>cruro-tarsal</i>, or situated between the proximal tarsal
bones and the tibia and fibula. Carpalia 4 and 5 are united
forming the <i>unciform</i>; and the ulnar sesamoid bone or <i>pisiform</i>
is generally well developed. In the proximal row of tarsal elements
there are only two bones, the calcaneum and astragalus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Of these the calcaneum is the fibulare, and the astragalus is
generally regarded as the tibiale and intermedium fused<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Subclass I.</i> <span class="smcap">Ornithodelphia or Prototheria.</span></p>

<p>This subclass contains only a single order, the Monotremata,
and the following characteristics are equally applicable
to the subclass and to the order. The vertebral centra have
no epiphyses, and the odontoid process remains for a long time
free from the centrum of the second vertebra. With the
exception of the atlas of <i>Echidna</i> the cervical vertebrae are
without zygapophyses. The cranial walls are smooth and
rounded, and the sutures between the several bones early
become completely obliterated as in birds. The mandible is a
very slight structure, with no ascending ramus, and with the
coronoid process (see p. 398) and angle rudimentary. The
auditory ossicles show a low state of development. The tubercula
of the ribs articulate with the sides of the centra of the
thoracic vertebrae, not with the transverse processes. Some of
the cervical ribs remain for a long time separate from the vertebrae.
Well ossified sternal ribs occur. No true teeth are present
in the adult. The young <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> has functional molar
teeth, but in the adult their place is taken by horny plates.
In the Echidnidae neither teeth nor horny plates occur.</p>

<p>The coracoid (fig. 66, 3) is complete and well developed,
and articulates with the sternum. A precoracoid (epicoracoid)
occurs in front of the coracoid, and there is a large interclavicle
(fig. 66, 6). The ridge on the scapula, corresponding to the
spine of other mammals, is situated on the anterior border
instead of in the middle of the outer surface. Epipubic bones
are present. In the Echidnidae, but not in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i><a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the central portion of the acetabulum is unossified as in birds.
The humerus has a prominent deltoid crest; its ends are much
expanded, and the distal end is pierced by an ent-epicondylar
foramen. The fibula has a broad proximal process resembling
an olecranon. The limbs and their girdles bear a striking
resemblance to those of some Theromorphous reptiles.</p>

<p>The order Monotremata includes only two living families,

<p><span class="smcap">Mesozoic Mammalia</span><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be well here to briefly refer to certain mammals
of small size, the remains of which have been found in deposits
of Mesozoic age. In the great majority of cases they
are known only by the lower jaw, or sometimes only by isolated
teeth. A large number of them are commonly grouped
together as the Multituberculata, and are sometimes, partly
owing to the resemblance of their teeth to those of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>,
placed with the Prototheria, sometimes between the
Prototheria and the Metatheria. They are characterised by
having a single pair of large incisors in the lower jaw, and one
large with one or two smaller incisors in each premaxillae.
The lower canines are very small or altogether wanting. The
incisors are separated by a diastema from the grinding teeth,
which are sometimes (<i>Tritylodon</i>) characterised by the possession
of longitudinal rows of little tubercles separated by
grooves, sometimes by having the premolars provided with
high cutting edges, whose surfaces are obliquely grooved.
Some of the Mesozoic mammals found associated with the
Multituberculata, have however a dentition of an altogether
different type, with at least three lower incisors, well developed
canines and premolars, and numerous molars with peculiar
three-cusped or tritubercular grinding surfaces. These mammals,
one of the best known of which is <i>Phascolotherium</i>, are
commonly separated from the Multituberculata, and are divided
by Osborn into two groups, one allied to the Marsupials, and
one to the Insectivores. The group showing Marsupial affinities
is further subdivided into carnivorous, omnivorous, and herbivorous
subgroups. The members of both groups commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
have four premolars, and six to eight molars in each mandibular
ramus.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Subclass II.</i> <span class="smcap">Didelphia or Metatheria.</span></p>

<p>This subclass, like the previous one, contains only a single
order, viz. the Marsupialia<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>; but the forms referable to it are
far more numerous than in the case of the Monotremata.</p>

<p>The integument is always furry, and the teeth are always
differentiated into incisors, canines, premolars and molars.
Except in <i>Phascolomys</i>, the number of incisors in the upper
and lower jaws is never equal, and the number in the upper
usually exceeds that in the lower jaw. There is no such
regular succession and displacement of teeth as in most mammals.
Sometimes the anterior teeth are diphyodont, and as a
general rule the tooth commonly regarded as the last premolar
is preceded by a milk tooth. The majority of the permanent
teeth of most Marsupials are regarded as belonging to the milk
series for two reasons, (1) they are developed from the more
superficial tissues of the jaws, (2) a second set, the permanent
teeth, begin to develop as outgrowths from them, but afterwards
become aborted<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>The odontoid process at an early stage becomes fused with
the centrum of the second cervical vertebra, and the number
of thoraco-lumbar vertebrae is always nineteen. The skull has
several characteristic features. The tympanic bone remains
permanently distinct, and the anterior boundary of the tympanic
cavity is formed by the alisphenoid. The carotid canal
perforates the basisphenoid, and the lachrymal canal opens
either outside the orbit or at its margin. There are generally
large vacuities in the palate. The angle of the mandible is
(except in <i>Tarsipes</i>) more or less inflected; and as a rule the
jugal furnishes part of the articular surface for the mandible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
There is no precoracoid (epicoracoid) or interclavicle, and the
coracoid is reduced to form a mere process of the scapula, not
coming near the sternum.</p>

<p>Epipubic, or so-called marsupial bones<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, nearly always
occur, and a fourth pelvic element, the acetabular bone, is
frequently developed. The fibula is always complete at its
distal end, sometimes it is fused with the tibia, but often it is
not only free but is capable of a rotatory movement on the
tibia. This is the case in the families Phascolomyidae, Didelphyidae,
and Phalangeridae.</p>

<p>The Marsupialia can be subdivided into two main groups,
according to the character of the teeth:&mdash;</p>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">Polyprotodontia.</span></p>

<p>In this group the incisors are small, subequal and numerous,
not less than 4/3. The canines are larger than the
incisors, and the molars have sharp cusps. The members of
this group are all more or less carnivorous or insectivorous.
The group includes the families Didelphyidae, Dasyuridae,
Peramelidae, and Notoryctidae<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">Diprotodontia.</span></p>

<p>In this group the incisors do not exceed 3/3, and are usually
3/1, occasionally 1/1. The first upper and lower incisors are large
and cutting. The lower canines are always small or absent,
and so in most cases are the upper canines. The molars have
bluntly tuberculated, or transversely ridged crowns. The
group includes the families Phascolomyidae, Phalangeridae,
Macropodidae, and Epanorthidae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Subclass III.</i> <span class="smcap">Monodelphia or Eutheria.</span></p>

<p>This great group includes all the Mammalia except the
orders Monotremata and Marsupialia. Coming to their
general characteristics&mdash;as in the Didelphia the odontoid
process and cervical ribs early become fused with the centra
which bear them, while the coracoid is reduced so as to form a
mere process on the scapula, and there is no precoracoid (epicoracoid),
such as is found in Ornithodelphia. Clavicles may
be present or absent; when fully developed they articulate
with the sternum, usually directly, but occasionally, as in some
Rodents and Insectivores, through the remains of the sternal
end of the precoracoid. There is never any interclavicle in
the adult, though sometimes traces of it occur during development.
In the pelvis the acetabula are imperforate; and well-developed
epipubic bones are never found in the adult,
though traces of them occur in some Carnivores and foetal
Ungulates.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 1.</i> <span class="smcap">Edentata</span><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p>Teeth are not, as the name of the order seems to imply,
always wanting; and sometimes they are very numerous.
They are, however, always imperfect, and, with very few
exceptions, are homodont and monophyodont. They have
persistent pulps, and so grow indefinitely and are never rooted.
In all living forms they are without enamel, consisting merely
of dentine and cement, and are never found in the front part of
the mouth in the situation occupied by the incisors of other
mammals. These characters derived from the teeth are the
only ones common to the various members of the order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
which includes the living sloths, ant-eaters, armadillos, pangolins
and aard varks, together with various extinct forms, chiefly
found in beds of late tertiary age in both North and South
America, the best known being the Megatheridae and Glyptodonts.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 2.</i> <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span><a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<p>The skeleton of these animals has a general fish-like form,
in correlation with their purely aquatic habits. The fore limbs
have the form of paddles, but the number of phalanges is not
increased beyond the normal. There are no external traces of
hind limbs.</p>

<p>The whole skeleton and especially the skull and ribs is
remarkably massive and heavy. The dentition varies; in the
two living genera <i>Manatus</i> and <i>Halicore</i>, incisor and molar
teeth are present, in one extinct genus, <i>Rhytina</i>, teeth are
entirely absent, while in another, <i>Halitherium</i>, the dentition
is more decidedly heterodont than in living forms. In the
two living genera the dentition is monophyodont, but in
<i>Halitherium</i> the anterior grinding teeth are preceded by
milk teeth. The tongue and anterior part of the palate and
lower jaw are covered with roughened horny plates. The
skull is noticeable for the size and backward position of the
anterior nares, also for the absence or small size of the nasal
bones. There is no union of certain of the vertebrae to form
a sacrum, and in living forms the centra are not terminated by
well-formed epiphyses<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae are much compressed, but they are
never ankylosed together. In <i>Manatus</i> there are only six
cervical vertebrae. The caudal vertebrae have well-developed
chevron bones. The humerus is distinctly articulated to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
radius and ulna, and these two bones are about equally developed,
and are often fused together. There are no clavicles,
and the pelvis is vestigial, consisting of a pair of somewhat
cylindrical bones suspended at some distance from the vertebral
column. In living forms there is no trace of a posterior
limb, but in <i>Halitherium</i> there is a vestigial femur connected
with each half of the pelvis.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 3.</i> <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p>In these mammals the general form is more fish-like than is
the case even in the Sirenia. The skin is generally almost
completely naked, but hairs are sometimes present in the neighbourhood
of the mouth, especially in the foetus. In some
Odontoceti vestiges of dermal ossicles have been described, and
in <i>Zeuglodon</i> the back was probably protected by dermal plates.
The anterior limbs have the form of flattened paddles, showing
no trace of nails, the posterior limb bones are quite vestigial
or absent, and there is never any external sign of the limb.
Teeth are always present at some period of the life history, but
in the whalebone whales they are only present during foetal
life, their place in the adult animal being taken by horny
plates of baleen. In all living forms the teeth are simple
and uniform structures without enamel; they have single
roots, and the alveoli in which they are imbedded are often
incompletely separated from one another. As in some forms
traces of a replacing dentition have been described, it has
been concluded that the functional teeth of Cetacea belong to
the milk dentition.</p>

<p>The texture of the bones is spongy. The cervical vertebrae
are very short, and though originally seven in number, are in
many forms completely fused, forming one solid mass (fig. 67).
The odontoid process of the axis is short and blunt, or may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
be completely wanting. The lumbar and caudal vertebrae are
large and numerous, and as zygapophyses are absent, are very
freely movable on one another; zygapophyses are also absent
from the posterior thoracic vertebrae. The lumbar vertebrae
are sometimes more numerous than the thoracic. The epiphyses
are very distinct, and do not unite with the centra till
the animal is quite adult. None of the vertebrae are united
to form a sacrum, but the caudal vertebrae have large chevron
bones.</p>

<p>The skull is peculiarly modified; the bones forming the
occipital segment show a specially strong development, and
the cranial cavity is short, high, and almost spherical. The
supra-occipital is very large and rises up to meet the frontals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
thus with the interparietal completely separating the parietals
from one another.</p>

<p>The frontals are expanded, forming large bony plates,
which roof over the orbits. The zygomatic process of the
squamosal is extremely large and extends forwards to meet
the supra-orbital process of the frontal; the zygomatic process
of the jugal is on the contrary very slender. The face is
drawn out into a long rostrum, formed of the maxillae and
premaxillae surrounding the vomer and the mesethmoid
cartilage. The maxillae are specially large, and extend backwards
so as to partially overlap the frontals. The nasals are
always small, and the anterior nares open upwards between
the cranium and rostrum. The periotics are loosely connected
with the other bones of the skull and the tympanics are commonly
large and dense. The mandible has hardly any coronoid
process, and the condyles are at its posterior end.</p>

<p>There are no clavicles, but the scapula and humerus are
well developed. The humerus moves freely in the glenoid
cavity, but all the other articulations of the anterior limb are
imperfect; the various bones have flattened ends, and are
connected with one another by fibrous tissue, which allows of
hardly any movement. Frequently the carpus is imperfectly
ossified.</p>

<p>The number of digits in the manus is generally five, sometimes
four, and when there are four digits it is the third and
not the first that is suppressed. The number of phalanges
in the second and third digits almost always exceeds that
which is normal in mammals, and the phalanges are also
remarkable for having epiphyses at both ends. The pelvis is
represented by two small bones which lie suspended horizontally
at some distance below the vertebral column; in some
cases vestiges of the skeleton of the hind limb are attached to
them.</p>

<p>The Cetacea are divided into three suborders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Archaeoceti.</span></p>

<p>The members of this group are extinct; they differ from
all living Cetacea in having the dentition heterodont and in
the fact that the back was probably protected by dermal
plates. The skull is elongated and depressed, and the brain
cavity is very small. The temporal fossae are large, and
there is a strong sagittal crest. The nasals and premaxillae
are a good deal larger than they are in living Cetacea, and
the anterior nares are usually far forward. The cervical vertebrae
are not fused with one another, and the lumbar
vertebrae are unusually elongated.</p>

<p>The limbs are very imperfectly known, but while the
humerus is much longer than in modern Cetaceans, it is
nevertheless flattened distally, indicating that the limb was
paddle-like, and that there was scarcely any free movement
between the fore-arm and upper arm.</p>

<p>The best known genus is <i>Zeuglodon</i>, which is found in
beds of Eocene age in various parts of Europe, and in Alabama.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Mystacoceti or Balaenoidea</span>.</p>

<p>These are the Whalebone Whales or True Whales.</p>

<p>Calcified teeth representing the milk dentition occur in the
foetus, but the teeth are never functional, and always disappear
before the close of foetal life. There is a definite
though small olfactory fossa. The palate is provided with
plates of baleen or whalebone. The skull is symmetrical, and
is extremely large in proportion to the body. The nasals are
moderately well developed, and the maxillae do not overlap
the orbital processes of the frontals. The lachrymals are small
and distinct from the jugals. The tympanics are ankylosed
to the periotics, and the rami of the mandible do not meet in
a true symphysis. The ribs articulate only with the transverse
processes, and the capitula are absent or imperfectly developed.
Only one pair of ribs meets the sternum, which is
composed of a single piece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The group includes among others the Right whale (<i>Balaena</i>),
Humpbacked whale (<i>Megaptera</i>), and Rorqual (<i>Balaenoptera</i>).</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (3). <span class="smcap">Odontoceti.</span></p>

<p>Teeth always exist after birth and baleen is never present.
The teeth are generally numerous, but are sometimes few and
deciduous; the dentition is homodont (except in <i>Squalodon</i>).
The dorsal surface of the skull is somewhat asymmetrical,
there is no trace of an olfactory fossa, the nasals are quite
rudimentary, and the hind ends of the maxillae cover part of
the frontals; in all these respects the skull differs from that
of the Mystacoceti. The lachrymal may either be united to
the jugal or may be large and distinct. The tympanic is
not ankylosed to the periotic. The rami of the mandible are
nearly straight and become united in a long symphysis. Some
of the ribs have well developed capitula articulating with the
vertebral centra. The sternum is almost always composed of
several pieces as in other mammals, and several pairs of ribs
are connected with it. There are always five digits to the
manus, though the first and fifth are usually very little
developed.</p>

<p>The suborder includes the Sperm Whale (<i>Physeter</i>), Narwhal
(<i>Monodon</i>), Dolphin (<i>Delphinus</i>), Porpoise (<i>Phocoena</i>),
and many other living forms as well as the extinct <i>Squalodon</i>
which differs from the other members of the suborder in its
heterodont dentition.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Order 4.</i> <span class="smcap">Ungulata.</span></p>

<p>This order includes a great and somewhat heterogeneous
group of animals, a large proportion of which are extinct.
They all (except certain extinct forms) agree in having the
ends of the digits either encased in hoofs or provided with
broad flat nails. The teeth are markedly heterodont and
diphyodont, and the molars have broad crowns with tuberculated
or ridged surfaces. Clavicles are never present in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
adult except in a few generalised extinct forms such as <i>Typotherium</i>,
and it is only recently that vestigial clavicles have
been discovered in the embryo<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. The scaphoid and lunar are
always distinct.</p>

<p>The order Ungulata may be subdivided into two main
groups, Ungulata vera and Subungulata.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Section I.</i> <span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span><a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.</p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae except the atlas are generally opisthocoelous.
The feet are never <i>plantigrade</i><a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. In all the
living and the great majority of the extinct forms the digits
do not exceed four, the first being suppressed. In the carpus
the os magnum articulates freely with the scaphoid, and is
separated from the cuneiform by the lunar and unciform. In
the tarsus the cuboid articulates with the astragalus as well as
with the calcaneum, and the proximal surface of the astragalus
is marked by a pulley-like groove. All the bones of
the carpus and tarsus strongly interlock. These characters
with regard to the carpus and tarsus do not hold in <i>Macrauchenia</i>
and its allies. The humerus never has an ent-epicondylar
foramen.</p>

<p>The group is divided into two very distinct suborders:&mdash;</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Artiodactyla.</span></p>

<p>The Artiodactyla have a number of well marked characters,
one of the most obvious being the fact that many of the
most characteristic forms have large paired outgrowths on the
frontal bones. These may be (1) solid deciduous bony <i>antlers</i>,
or (2) more or less hollow bony outgrowths which are sheathed
with permanently growing horn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The premolar and molar teeth are usually dissimilar, the
premolars being one-lobed and the molars two-lobed; the last
lower molar of both the milk and permanent dentitions is
almost always three-lobed.</p>

<p>The grinding surfaces of the molar teeth have a tendency
to assume one of two forms. In the Pigs and their allies the
crowns are bunodont[1], while in the more highly specialised
Ruminants the crowns are selenodont<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. The nasals are not
expanded posteriorly, and there is no alisphenoid canal<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. The
thoraco-lumbar vertebrae are always nineteen. The symphysis
of the ischia and pubes is very elongated, and the femur has
no third trochanter. The limbs never have more than four
digits, and are symmetrical about a line drawn between the
third and fourth digits; the digits, on the other hand, are
never symmetrical in themselves. The astragalus has pulley-like
surfaces both proximally and distally, and articulates with
the navicular and cuboid by two nearly equal facets. The
calcaneum articulates with the lower end of the fibula when
that bone is fully developed.</p>

<p>In the Artiodactyla are included the following living
groups:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Suina. Pigs and Hippopotami.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Tylopoda. Camels and Llamas.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Tragulina. Chevrotains.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Ruminantia or Pecora. Deer, giraffes, oxen, sheep
and antelopes.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Perissodactyla</span><a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>In this group there are never any bony outgrowths from
the frontals. The grinding teeth form a continuous series,
the posterior premolars resembling the molars in complexity,
and the last lower molar generally has no third lobe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
cervical vertebrae with the exception of the atlas almost
always have markedly opisthocoelous centra, but in <i>Macrauchenia</i>
they are flat. The nasals are expanded posteriorly, and
an alisphenoid canal is present. The thoraco-lumbar vertebrae
are never less than twenty-two in number and are usually
twenty-three. The femur has a third trochanter (except in
<i>Chalicotherium</i>). The third digit of the manus and pes is
symmetrical in itself, and larger than the others, and in some
cases the other digits are quite vestigial. The number of the
digits of the pes is always odd. The astragalus is abruptly
truncated distally, and the facet by which it articulates with
the cuboid, is much smaller than that by which it articulates
with the navicular. The calcaneum does not articulate with
the fibula, except in <i>Macrauchenia</i>. The group includes many
extinct forms, and the living families of the Tapirs, Horses
and Asses, and Rhinoceroses.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Section II.</i> <span class="smcap">Subungulata.</span></p>

<p>In this group is placed a heterogeneous collection of
animals, the great majority of which are extinct. There is
really no characteristic which is common to them all, and
which serves to distinguish them as a group from the Ungulata
vera. But the most distinctive character common to the
greatest number of them is to be found in the carpus, whose
bones in most cases retain their primitive relation to one
another, the os magnum articulating with the lunar and sometimes
just meeting the cuneiform, but in living forms at any
rate not articulating with the scaphoid. The feet frequently
have five functional digits, and may be plantigrade. The
proximal surface of the astragalus is generally flattened instead
of being pulley-like as in Ungulata vera.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Toxodontia.</span></p>

<p>This suborder includes some very aberrant extinct South
American ungulates, which have characters recalling the
Proboscidea, both groups of Ungulata vera, and the Rodentia.
The limbs are subplantigrade or digitigrade, and the digits
are three, rarely five, in number, the third being most
developed. The carpus resembles that of the Ungulata vera,
in that the bones interlock and the magnum articulates with
the scaphoid. In the tarsus, however, the bones do not
interlock. The astragalus has a pulley-like proximal surface
(except in <i>Astrapotherium</i>, in which it is flat), and
articulates only with the navicular, not meeting the cuboid.
The calcaneum has a large facet for articulation with the
fibula, as in Artiodactyla. There is no alisphenoid canal, and
the orbit is confluent with the temporal fossa. Some of the
forms (e.g. <i>Nesodon</i>) referred to this group have the typical
mammalian series of forty-four teeth, but in others the canines
are undeveloped. In <i>Toxodon</i> all the cheek teeth have persistent
pulps, while in <i>Nesodon</i> and <i>Astrapotherium</i> they are rooted.
A clavicle is sometimes present (<i>Typotherium</i>), and the femur
sometimes has a third trochanter (<i>Typotherium</i> and <i>Astrapotherium</i>),
sometimes is without one (<i>Toxodon</i>).</p>

<p>The remains of these curious Ungulates have been found
in beds of late Tertiary age in South America.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Condylarthra</span><a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>This group includes some comparatively small extinct
ungulates, which are best known from the Lower Eocene of
Wyoming, though their remains have also been found in
deposits of similar age in France and Switzerland. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
characters are little specialised, and they show relationship on
the one hand to the Ungulata vera and on the other to the
Hyracoidea. They also have characters allying them to the
Carnivora. They generally have the typical mammalian
series of forty-four teeth, the molars being brachydont and
generally bunodont. The premolars are more simple than the
molars. The limbs are plantigrade, and have five digits with
rather pointed ungual phalanges. The os magnum, as in living
Subungulates, articulates with the lunar, not reaching the
scaphoid. The astragalus has an elongated neck, a pulley-like
proximal and a convex distal articular surface, and does not
articulate with the cuboid. The humerus has an ent-epicondylar
foramen, and the femur has a third trochanter. The best
known genus is <i>Phenacodus</i>; it is perhaps the most primitive
ungulate whose skeleton is thoroughly well known, and is of
special interest from the fact that it is regarded as the lowest
stage in the evolutionary series of the horse. Its remains
are found in the Lower Eocene of Wyoming.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (3). <span class="smcap">Hyracoidea</span><a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p>This group of animals is very isolated, having no very close
allies, either living or extinct. The digits are provided with
flat nails, except the second digit of the pes, which is clawed.
Canine teeth are absent, and the dental formula is usually
given as <i>i</i> &frac12;, <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub>, <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. The upper incisors are long
and curved, and have persistent pulps as in Rodents; their
terminations are, however, pointed, not chisel-shaped, as in
Rodents. The lower incisors have pectinated edges. The
grinding teeth have a pattern much like that in <i>Rhinoceros</i>.
In the skull (fig. 83) the postorbital processes of the frontal
and jugal almost or quite meet. The jugal forms part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
glenoid cavity for articulation with the mandible, and also
extends forwards so as to meet the lachrymal. There is an
alisphenoid canal. There are as many as twenty-one or twenty-two
thoracic vertebrae, and the number of thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae reaches twenty-eight or thirty. There are no clavicles,
and the scapula has no acromion; the coracoid process
is, however, well developed. The ulna is complete. In the
manus the second, third and fourth digits are approximately
equal in size, the fifth is smaller, and the first is vestigial.
The femur has a slight ridge representing the third trochanter.
The fibula is complete, but is generally fused with the tibia
proximally. There is a complicated articulation between the
tibia and astragalus, which has a pulley-like proximal surface.
In the pes the three middle digits are well developed, but there
is no trace of a hallux, and the fifth digit is represented only
by a vestigial metatarsal.</p>

<p>The only representatives of the suborder are some small
animals belonging to the genus <i>Procavia</i> (<i>Hyrax</i>), which is
found in Africa and Syria; some of the species are by many
authors placed in a distinct genus <i>Dendrohyrax</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (4). <span class="smcap">Amblypoda</span><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>This suborder includes a number of primitive extinct
Ungulates, many of which are of great size. Their most
distinguishing characteristics are afforded by the extremities.
In the carpus the bones interlock a little more than is the case
in most Subungulata, and the corner of the os magnum reaches
the scaphoid, while the lunar articulates partially with both
magnum and unciform, instead of only with the magnum.
In the tarsus the cuboid articulates with both the calcaneum
and the astragalus, which is remarkably flat. The manus and
pes are short, nearly or quite plantigrade, and have the full
number of digits. The cranial cavity is singularly small.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Canine teeth are present in both jaws, and the grinding teeth
have short crowns, marked by <b>V</b>-shaped ridges. The pelvis is
large, the ilia are placed vertically, and the ischia do not take
part in the ventral symphysis.</p>

<p>The best known animals belonging to this suborder are the
Uintatheriidae (Dinocerata)<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, found in the Upper Eocene of
Wyoming. They are as large as elephants, and are characterised
by the long narrow skull drawn out into three pairs
of rounded protuberances, by the strong occipital crest, and
by the very large upper canines.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (5). <span class="smcap">Proboscidea.</span></p>

<p>This suborder includes the largest of land mammals, the
Elephants, and certain of their extinct allies. The limbs are
strong, and are vertically placed; the proximal segment is the
longest, and the manus and pes are pentedactylate and subplantigrade.
The digits are all enclosed in a common integument,
and each is provided with a broad hoof. The vertebral
centra are much flattened and compressed, especially in the cervical
region. The number of thoracic vertebrae is very great,
reaching twenty. The skull (figs. 96 and 97) is extremely large,
this being due to the great development of air cells, which
takes place in nearly all the bones of the adult skull. In the
young skull there are hardly any air cells, and the growth of
the cranial cavity does not by any means keep pace with the
growth of the skull in general. The supra-occipital is very
large, and forms a considerable part of the roof of the skull.
The nasals and jugals are short, and the premaxillae very
large. The rami of the mandible meet in a long symphysis, and
the ascending portion is very high. Canine teeth are absent,
and the incisors have the form of ever-growing tusks composed
mainly of dentine; in living forms they are present in the
upper jaw only. The grinding teeth are large, and in living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
forms have a very complex structure and mode of succession.
In some of the extinct forms, such as <i>Mastodon</i> and especially
<i>Dinotherium</i>, the teeth are much more simple. In every case
the teeth have the same general structure, consisting of a
series of ridges of dentine, coated with enamel. In the more
specialised forms the valleys between the ridges are filled up
with cement. The acromion of the scapula has a recurved
process, similar to that often found in rodents. Clavicles are
absent. The radius and ulna are not ankylosed, but are
incapable of any rotatory movement. All the bones of the
extremities are very short and thick; the scaphoid articulates
regularly with the trapezoid and the lunar with the magnum.
The ilia are vertically placed, and are very much expanded;
the ischia and pubes are small, and form a short symphysis.
The femur has no third trochanter, and the tibia and fibula
are distinct. The fibula articulates with the calcaneum, and
the astragalus is very flat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Here brief reference may be made to the <span class="smcap">Tillodontia</span><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, a
group of extinct mammals found in the Eocene beds of both
Europe and North America. They seem to connect together
the Ungulata, Rodentia, and Carnivora.</p>

<p>The skull resembles that of bears, but the grinding teeth
are of Ungulate type, while the second incisors resemble those
of rodents, and have persistent pulps. The femur has a third
trochanter, and the feet resemble those of bears in being
plantigrade and having pointed ungual phalanges, differing,
however, in having the scaphoid and lunar distinct.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 5.</i> <span class="smcap">Rodentia.</span></p>

<p>The Rodents form a very large and well-defined group of
mammals easily distinguishable by their peculiar dentition.
Canines are absent, and the incisors are very large and curved,
growing from persistent pulps. They are rectangular in section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and are much more thickly coated with enamel on their
anterior face than elsewhere; consequently, as they wear down
they acquire and retain a chisel-shaped (scalpriform) edge.
There is never more than one pair of incisors in the mandible,
and except in the Hares and Rabbits, there is similarly only a
single pair in the upper jaw. These animals are, too, the only
rodents which have well developed deciduous incisors. There
is always a long diastema separating the incisors from the
grinding teeth. The grinding teeth, which are arranged in a
continuous series, vary in number from two to six in the upper
jaw, and from two to five in the lower jaw. The number of
premolars is always below the normal, often they are altogether
wanting, but generally they are <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub>. Sometimes the grinding
teeth form roots, sometimes they grow persistently.</p>

<p>The premaxillae are always large, and the orbits always communicate
freely with the temporal fossae. The condyle of the
mandible is elongated from before backwards, and owing to
the absence of a postglenoid process to the squamosal, a backward
and forward motion of the jaw can take place. The
zygomatic arch is complete, but the jugal is short and only
forms the middle of it. The palate is small, being sometimes,
as in the hares, narrowed from before backwards,
sometimes as in the mole-rats (Bathyerginae) narrowed transversely.</p>

<p>The thoraco-lumbar vertebrae are usually nineteen in
number. Clavicles are generally present, and the acromion
of the scapula is commonly very long. The feet are as a rule
plantigrade, and provided with five clawed digits.</p>

<p>There are two main groups of Rodentia; the Duplicidentata,
or Hares and Rabbits, which have two pairs of upper
incisors, whose enamel extends round to the posterior surface;
and the Simplicidentata, in which there is only a single pair
of upper incisors, whose enamel is confined to the anterior
surface. This group includes all the Rodents except the
Hares and Rabbits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 6.</i> <span class="smcap">Carnivora.</span></p>

<p>The living Carnivora form a natural and well-marked
group, but as is the case with so many other groups of
animals, when their extinct allies are included, it becomes
impossible to readily define them.</p>

<p>The manus and pes never have less than four well-developed
digits, and these are nearly always provided with more or less
pointed nails, generally with definite claws. The hallux and
pollex are never opposable. The dentition is diphyodont and
markedly heterodont. The teeth are always rooted, except
in the case of the canines of the Walrus. The incisors are
generally <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, and are comparatively small, while the canines
are large, pointed, and slightly recurved. The cheek teeth are
variable, and are generally more or less compressed and
pointed; sometimes their crowns are flattened and tuberculated,
but they are never divided into lobes by deep infoldings
of enamel. The squamosal is drawn out into a postglenoid
process, and the mandible has a large coronoid process. The
condyle of the mandible is transversely elongated, and the
glenoid fossa is very deep; in consequence of this arrangement
the mandible can perform an up and down movement only,
any rotatory or back and fore movement being impossible.
The jugal is large, and the zygomatic arch generally strong,
while the orbit and temporal fossa are in most cases completely
confluent. The scapula has a large spine. The clavicle is
never complete and is often absent, this forming an important
distinction between the skeleton of a Carnivore and of any
Insectivore except <i>Potamogale</i>. The humerus often has an
ent-epicondylar foramen, and the radius and ulna, tibia and
fibula are always separate. The manus is often capable of the
movements of pronation and supination, and the scaphoid,
lunar and centrale are in living forms always united together.</p>

<p>The order Carnivora includes three suborders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Creodonta</span><a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>This suborder contains a number of extinct Carnivora,
which present very generalised characters.</p>

<p>The cranial cavity is very small; and the fourth upper premolar
and first lower molar are not differentiated as carnassial
teeth<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, as they are in modern Carnivora. The Creodonta also
differ from modern Carnivora in the fact that the scaphoid and
lunar are usually separate, and that the femur has a third
trochanter. The feet are plantigrade.</p>

<p>They resemble the Condylarthra, another very generalised
group, in having an ent-epicondylar foramen.</p>

<p>They occurred throughout the Tertiary period in both
Europe and North America, and have also been found in India.
One of the best known genera is <i>Hyaenodon</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Carnivora vera</span> or <span class="smcap">Fissipedia</span>.</p>

<p>The skeleton is mainly adapted for a terrestrial mode of
life, and the hind limbs have the normal mammalian position.
In almost every case the number of incisors is <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. Each jaw
always has one specially modified <i>carnassial</i> or sectorial tooth
which bites like a scissors blade against a corresponding tooth
in the other jaw. In front of it the teeth are always more
or less pointed, while behind it they are more or less broadened
and tuberculated. In the manus the first digit, and in the
pes the first and fifth digits are never longer than the rest,
and the digits of both limbs are almost invariably clawed.
Some forms are plantigrade, some digitigrade, some subplantigrade.
The group includes all the ordinary terrestrial
Carnivora, and is divided into three sections:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&AElig;luroidea<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, including the cats, civets, hyaenas, and allied
forms.</p>

<p>Cynoidea, including the dog tribe.</p>

<p>Arctoidea, including the bears, raccoons, weasels, and allied
forms.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (3). <span class="smcap">Pinnipedia</span><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>In this suborder the limbs are greatly modified and adapted
for a more or less purely aquatic life, the proximal and middle
segments of the limbs are shortened, while the distal segment,
especially in the leg, is much elongated and expanded. There are
always five well-developed digits to each limb, and in the pes the
first and fifth digits are generally larger than the others. The
digits generally bear straight nails instead of claws, but even
nails are sometimes absent. There is no carnassial tooth, and
the teeth in other ways differ considerably from those of Carnivora
vera. The incisors are always fewer than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>; while the
cheek teeth generally consist of four premolars and one molar,
all of very uniform character, being compressed with conical
crowns, and never more than two roots.</p>

<p>The suborder includes three families&mdash;Otariidae (Eared
Seals), Trichechidae (Walrus), and Phocidae (Seals).</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 7.</i> <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span><a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>This order contains a large number of small generally terrestrial
mammals. The limbs are plantigrade or subplantigrade,
and are generally pentedactylate. All the digits are armed
with claws, and the pollex and hallux are not opposable. The
teeth are diphyodont, heterodont, and rooted. The cheek teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
have tuberculated crowns, and there are never less than two
pairs of incisors in the mandible; often the incisors, canines,
and premolars are not clearly differentiated from one another,
and special carnassial teeth are never found. The cranial cavity
is small, and the facial part of the skull is generally much
developed; often the zygomatic arch is incomplete. Clavicles
are well developed (except in <i>Potamogale</i>), and the humerus
generally has an ent-epicondylar foramen. The femur frequently
has a ridge representing the third trochanter. There
are two suborders:</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Dermoptera.</span></p>

<p>This suborder includes only a very aberrant arboreal genus
<i>Galeopithecus</i>, remarkable for its greatly elongated limb bones,
and peculiar dentition. The incisors of the lower jaw are
deeply pectinated or divided by several vertical fissures, the
canines and outer upper incisors have two roots. Ossified
inter centra occur in the thoraco-lumbar region of the vertebral
column.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Insectivora vera.</span></p>

<p>This suborder includes all the ordinary Insectivora, such as
moles, shrews and hedgehogs. The upper and lower incisors
are conical, not pectinated.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 8.</i> <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span><a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>This order is perhaps the best marked and most easily
defined of all the orders of mammals. The anterior limbs
form true wings and the whole skeleton is modified in relation
to flight.</p>

<p>The anterior limbs are vastly larger than the posterior;
for all the bones except the carpals are much elongated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
this applies specially to the phalanges of all the digits except
the pollex.</p>

<p>The pollex is clawed and so is sometimes the second digit;
the other digits of the manus are without nails or claws. The
teeth are divisible into the four usual types and the series
never exceeds <i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1 </sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>  <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>  × 2, total 38. The milk
teeth are quite unlike the permanent teeth. The orbit is not
divided by bone from the temporal fossa. The vertebral
column is short, and in old animals the trunk vertebrae
have a tendency to become partially fused together. The
cervical vertebrae are remarkably wide, and the development
of spinous processes is everywhere slight. The presternum
has a prominent keel for the attachment of the pectoral muscles.
The clavicles are very long and strong, and the scapula has a
long spine and coracoid process. The ulna is vestigial, consisting
only of a proximal end ankylosed to the radius. All
the carpals of the proximal row&mdash;the scaphoid, lunar and
cuneiform&mdash;are united, forming a single bone. The pelvis is
very weak and narrow, and only in the Rhinolophidae do the
pubes meet in a symphysis. The anterior caudal vertebrae are
frequently united to the ischia. The fibula is generally vestigial,
and the knee joint is directed backwards instead of
forwards. The pes has five slender clawed digits, and the
calcaneum is often drawn out into a spur which helps
to support the membrane connecting the hind limbs with the
tail.</p>

<p>There are two suborders of Chiroptera:</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Megachiroptera</span> or Flying foxes, which almost
always have smooth crowns to the molar teeth, and the second
digit of the manus clawed.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Microchiroptera</span> including all the ordinary bats
which have cusped molar teeth, and the second digit of the
manus clawless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Order 9.</i> <span class="smcap">Primates.</span></p>

<p>The dentition is diphyodont and heterodont, the incisors
generally number <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and the molars, except in the Hapalidae
(Marmosets), are <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. The cheek teeth are adapted for grinding,
and the molars are more complex than the premolars.
A process from the jugal meets the postorbital process of the
frontal completing the postorbital bar.</p>

<p>The clavicle is well developed, and the radius and ulna
are never united. The scaphoid and lunar of the carpus,
and commonly also the centrale, remain distinct from one
another. As a rule both manus and pes have five digits,
but the pollex may be vestigial. The pollex is opposable to
the other digits, and so is the hallux except in Man; the
digits are almost always provided with flat nails. The humerus
has no ent-epicondylar foramen and the femur has no
third trochanter.</p>

<p>The order Primates is divisible into two suborders:</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (1). <span class="smcap">Lemuroidea.</span></p>

<p>The skull has the orbit communicating freely with the
temporal fossa beneath the postorbital bar (except in <i>Tarsius</i>).
The lachrymal foramen is external to the margin of
the orbit. Both pollex and hallux are well developed. In
the pes the second digit is terminated by a long pointed claw,
and so is also the third in <i>Tarsius</i>. The lumbar region of
the vertebral column is long, sometimes including as many as
nine vertebrae. Besides the Lemurs the group includes the
aberrant <i>Tarsius</i> and <i>Chiromys</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Suborder</i> (2). <span class="smcap">Anthropoidea.</span></p>

<p>The skull has the orbit almost completely shut off from
the temporal fossa, and the lachrymal foramen is situated
within the orbit. The pollex is sometimes vestigial or absent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
The second digit of the pes has a flattened nail except in the
Hapalidae, in which all the digits of the pes except the hallux
are clawed.</p>

<p>The Anthropoidea are divided into five families:</p>

<p>1. Hapalidae or Marmosets.</p>

<p>2. Cebidae or American Monkeys.</p>

<p>3. Cercopithecidae or Old World Monkeys.</p>

<p>4. Simiidae or Anthropoid Apes.</p>

<p>5. Hominidae or Men.</p>

<small>THE SKELETON OF THE
DOG<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
(<i>Canis familiaris</i>).</small></h2>


<p>I. EXOSKELETON.</p>

<p>The exoskeleton of the dog includes three sets of structures:
1. hairs, 2. claws, 3. teeth. <b>Hairs</b> and <b>claws</b> are epidermal
exoskeletal structures, while <b>teeth</b> are partly of dermal, and
partly of epidermal origin.</p>

<p>1. <b>Hairs</b> are delicate epidermal structures which grow
imbedded in little pits or follicles in the dermis. Specially
large hairs forming the <b>vibrissae</b> or <b>whiskers</b> grow attached
to the upper lip.</p>

<p>2. <b>Claws</b> are horny epidermal sheaths, one of which fits
on to the pointed distal phalanx of each digit. They are
sharply curved structures, and being in the dog non-retractile,
their points are commonly much blunted by friction with the
ground. The claws of the pollex, and of the hallux when it is
present, however do not meet the ground, and therefore remain
comparatively sharp.</p>

<p>3. <b>Teeth</b><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. Although as regards their mode of origin,
teeth are purely exoskeletal or tegumentary structures, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
become so intimately connected with the skull that they appear
to belong to the endoskeleton.</p>

<p>Each tooth, as has been already described, consists of three
distinct tissues, dentine and cement of dermal origin, and
enamel of epidermal origin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68. Dentition of a Dog</span> (<i>Canis familiaris</i>) × &frac12;. (Camb. Mus.)

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><i>i</i> 2. second incisor.</td><td align="left"><i>pm</i> 1, <i>pm</i> 4. first and fourth</td></tr>

</table></div></div>

<p>The teeth of the dog (fig. 68) form a regular series arranged
along the margins of both upper and lower jaws, and imbedded
in pits or <b>alveoli</b> of the maxillae, premaxillae, and mandibles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
They are all fixed in the bone by tapering roots, and none of
them grow from persistent pulps.</p>

<p>They are divisible into four distinct groups, the <b>incisors</b>,
<b>canines</b>, <b>premolars</b> and <b>molars</b>. There are three incisors,
one canine and four premolars on each side of each jaw.
But while there are three molars on each side of the lower
jaw, the last is wanting in the upper jaw. The dentition of
the dog may then be represented by the formula</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> × 2 = 42.</p>


<p>In each jaw there is one large specially modified tooth
called the <b>carnassial</b>, the teeth in front of this are more or
less pointed and compressed, while those behind it are more or
less flattened and tuberculated.</p>

<p><b>Teeth of the upper jaw.</b></p>

<p>The first and second <b>incisors</b> are small teeth with long
conical roots and somewhat chisel-shaped crowns. Surrounding
the base of the crown there is a rather prominent ridge,
terminated laterally by a pair of small cusps. This ridge, the
<b>cingulum</b>, serves to protect the edge of the gums from injury
by the hard parts of food. The third incisor is a good deal
like the others but larger, and has the cingulum well developed
though not terminated by lateral cusps. All the incisors
are borne by the premaxillae, the remaining teeth by the
maxillae.</p>

<p>The <b>canine</b> is a large pointed tooth, slightly recurved and
with a long tapering root.</p>

<p>The <b>premolars</b> are four in number, and in all the cingulum
is fairly well seen. The first is a very small tooth with a
single tapering root, the second and third are larger and have
two roots, while the fourth, the <b>carnassial</b>, is much the largest
and has three roots. Each of the second, third and fourth premolars
has a stout blade, the middle portion of which is drawn
out into a prominent cone; the posterior part of the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
premolar forms a compressed ridge, and at the antero-internal
edge of the tooth there is a small inner tubercle.</p>

<p>The two <b>molar</b> teeth are of very unequal size. The first,
which has two anterior roots and one posterior, is wider than
it is long, its outer portion being produced into two prominent
cusps, while its inner portion is depressed. The second molar
is a small tooth resembling the first in its general appearance,
but with much smaller outer cusps.</p>

<p><b>Teeth of the lower jaw.</b></p>

<p>The three <b>incisors</b> of the lower jaw have much the same
character as the first two of the upper jaw; while the <b>canine</b>
is identical in character with that of the upper jaw.</p>

<p>The four <b>premolars</b> gradually increase in size from the
first to the last, but none are very large. The first premolar
is a single-rooted tooth resembling that of the upper jaw; the
second, third and fourth are two-rooted, like the second and
third of the upper jaw, which they closely resemble in other
respects.</p>

<p>The first <b>molar</b> forms the <b>carnassial</b> (fig. 84, V), and with
the exception of the canine, is much the largest tooth of the
lower jaw; it is a two-rooted tooth, with a long compressed
bilobed blade, and a posterior tuberculated talon or heel. The
second molar is much smaller, though likewise two-rooted, while
the third molar is very small and has only a single root. All
the teeth except the molars are preceded in the young animal
by temporary <b>milk teeth</b>. These milk teeth, though smaller,
are very similar to the permanent teeth by which they are
ultimately replaced.</p>


<p>II. ENDOSKELETON.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Axial skeleton.</span></p>

<p>This includes the vertebral column, the skull, and the ribs
and sternum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Vertebral column.</span></p>

<p>This consists of a series of about forty vertebrae arranged
in succession so that their centra form a continuous rod, and
their neural arches a continuous tube, surrounding a cavity,
the <b>neural canal</b>.</p>

<p>The vertebrae may be readily divided into five groups:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <b>cervical</b> or neck vertebrae.</p>

<p>2. The <b>thoracic</b> or chest vertebrae which bear ribs.</p>

<p>3. The <b>lumbar</b> vertebrae which are large and ribless.</p>

<p>4. The <b>sacral</b> vertebrae which are fused with one another
and united with the pelvis.</p>

<p>5. The <b>caudal</b> or tail vertebrae which are small.</p>

<p>Except in the sacral region the vertebrae are movably
articulated to one another, while their centra are separated
from one another by cartilaginous <b>intervertebral discs</b>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">General characters of a vertebra.</span></p>

<p>Take as a type the <b>fourth lumbar vertebra</b>. It may
be compared to a short tube whose inner surface is smooth
and regular, and whose outer surface is thickened and drawn
out in a variety of ways. The basal part of the vertebra
is the <b>centrum</b> or body which forms the thickened floor of
the neural canal. Its two ends are slightly convex and
are formed by the <b>epiphyses</b>, two thin plates of bone which
are at first altogether distinct from the main part of the centrum,
but fuse with it as the animal grows older; its sides are
drawn out into a pair of strong <b>transverse processes</b>, which
project forwards, outwards, and slightly downwards. The
<b>neural arch</b> forms the sides and roof of the neural canal, and
at each end just above the centrum bears a pair of <b>intervertebral
notches</b> for the passage of the spinal nerves, the posterior
notches being considerably deeper than the anterior. The
neural arch is drawn out into a series of processes. Arising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
from the centre of the dorsal surface is a prominent median
<b>neural spine</b> or <b>spinous process</b>, which projects upwards
and slightly forwards; its anterior edge is vertical, while its
posterior edge slopes gradually. At the two ends of the
neural arch arise the two pairs of <b>zygapophyses</b> or articulating
surfaces, which interlock with those of the adjacent
vertebrae. The anterior or <b>prezygapophyses</b> look inwards,
and are large and concave; they are borne upon a pair of
large blunt outgrowths of the neural arch, the <b>metapophyses</b>.
The posterior or <b>postzygapophyses</b> are slightly convex and
look outwards and downwards; they are borne upon backwardly
projecting outgrowths of the neural arch. Lastly
there are a pair of minute projections arising from the
posterior end of the neural arch, below the postzygapophyses.
These are the <b>anapophyses</b>. In young individuals the development
of all the processes of the various vertebrae is less
marked, and the epiphyses are obviously distinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Cervical vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>These are seven in number, as in almost all mammals.
They are characterised by the fact that they have small ribs
fused with them, forming transverse processes perforated by
canals through which the vertebral arteries run.</p>

<p>The first, or <b>atlas</b> vertebra (fig. 69, A), differs much from
all the others; it is drawn out into a pair of wide wing-like
transverse processes (fig. 69, A, 1), and forms a ring surrounding
a large cavity. This cavity is during life divided into
two parts by a transverse ligament; the upper cavity is the
true neural canal, while the lower lodges the <b>odontoid process</b>
of the second vertebra, which is the detached centrum
of the atlas. The neural arch is broad and regular; it has
no spinous process, and is perforated in front by a pair of
foramina for the passage of the first spinal nerves. The mid-ventral
portion of the atlas is rather thick, and bears a minute
backwardly-projecting hypapophysis. The bases of the broad
transverse processes are perforated by the <b>vertebrarterial
canals</b> (fig. 69, A, 2). The atlas bears at each end a pair of
large articulating surfaces; those at the anterior end articulate
with the condyles of the skull, and are very deeply concave;
those at the posterior end for articulation with the axis, are
nearly as large, but are flattened. The atlas ossifies from
three centres, one forming the mid-ventral portion, the others
the two halves of the remainder.</p>

<p>The second, or <b>axis</b> vertebra (fig. 69, B), also differs much
from the other cervicals. The long and broad centrum has
a very flat dorsal surface, and is produced in front into
the conical <b>odontoid process</b> (fig. 69, B, 5), and bears a
pair of very large convex outwardly-directed surfaces for articulation
with the atlas. At its posterior end it is drawn
out into a pair of small backwardly-directed spines, the
transverse processes; these are perforated at their bases by
the vertebrarterial canals. The neural arch is deeply notched
in front and behind for the passage of the spinal nerves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
is drawn out above into a very long compressed neural spine
(fig. 69, B, 4), which projects a long way forwards, and behind
becomes bifid and thickened, bearing a pair of flat downwardly
directed postzygapophyses. In the young animal the odontoid
process is readily seen to ossify from a centre anterior to that
forming the anterior epiphysis of the axis.</p>

<p>The remaining five cervical vertebrae, the third to the
seventh inclusive, have rather flattened wide centra, obliquely
truncated at either end. The neural spine progressively increases
in size as the vertebrae are followed back. The transverse
processes vary considerably; those of the third are divided
into a thicker backwardly-, and a more slender forwardly-projecting
portion; those of the fourth and fifth mainly extend
downwards, and that of the sixth is divided into a horizontal
portion and a downwardly-projecting <b>inferior lamella</b>. All
the cervical vertebrae except the seventh have the bases of the
transverse processes perforated by the vertebrarterial canals.
The prezygapophyses in each case look upwards and slightly
inwards, while the postzygapophyses look downwards and
slightly outwards.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Thoracic vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>thoracic vertebrae</b> are twelve or thirteen in number,
and all bear movably articulated ribs. As a group they are
characterised by their comparative shortness, and in the case
of the first eight or nine by the great length of the backwardly-sloping
neural spine. The posterior thoracic vertebrae
approach in character the succeeding lumbar vertebrae.</p>

<p>As type of the anterior thoracic vertebrae, take any one
between the second and sixth inclusive. The centrum is short,
and has its terminations vertically truncated. At the top of
the centrum, at both anterior and posterior ends on each side,
is a demi-facet (fig. 70, A, 4), which, together with that on the
adjacent vertebra, forms an articulating surface for the capitulum
of the rib. The neural arch is small and deeply notched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
behind for the passage of the spinal nerve. It is drawn out
above into a very long neural spine (fig. 70, A, 1), whose base
extends back over the succeeding vertebra and bears the downwardly-directed
postzygapophyses (fig. 70, A, 6). The summit
of the neural arch is deeply notched in front, and on each side
of the notch are the prezygapophyses, which look almost vertically
upwards. The transverse processes are short and blunt,
and are flattened below (fig. 70, A, 3) for the articulation of
the tubercula of the ribs.</p>

<p>The posterior three or four thoracic vertebrae differ much
from the others. The centra are longer, the neural spines short
and not directed backwards, the articular facets for the heads
of the ribs are confined to the anterior end of the centrum of
each vertebra, not overlapping on to the preceding vertebra.
The transverse processes are small and irregular, and metapophyses
and anapophyses are developed. The prezygapophyses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
also look more inwards, and the postzygapophyses more outwards
than in the more typical thoracic vertebrae.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Lumbar vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>lumbar vertebrae</b> are seven in number, and their
general characteristics have been already described. As a
group they are characterised by their large size, and the great
development of the transverse processes, metapophyses and
neural spines.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sacral vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>Three vertebrae are commonly found fused together, forming
the <b>sacrum</b>; the divisions between the three being indicated
by the foramina for the exit of the spinal nerves.</p>

<p>Of these three vertebrae, the first is much the largest,
and is firmly united to the ilium on each side by a structure
formed by the transverse processes and expanded ribs. In the
adult this structure forms one continuous mass, but in the
young animal a ventral portion formed by the rib is clearly
distinguishable from a dorsal portion formed by the transverse
process. All three have low neural spines. The anterior
sacral vertebra bears a large pair of prezygapophyses, while
the posterior one bears a small pair of postzygapophyses.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Caudal vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The <b>caudal vertebrae</b> are about nineteen in number.
The earlier ones have well-developed neural arches, transverse
processes, and zygapophyses, but as the vertebrae are followed
back they gradually lose all their processes, and the neural arch
as well, becoming at about the thirteenth from the end reduced
to simple cylindrical centra.</p>


<p>B. <span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p>The <b>skull</b> consists of the following three parts: (<i>a</i>) the
cranium, with which are included the skeletal supports of the
various special sense organs, and the bones of the face and
upper jaw; (<i>b</i>) the lower jaw or mandible, which is movably
articulated to the cranium, and (<i>c</i>) the hyoid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">The Cranium.</span></p>

<p>The cranium is a compact bony box, forming the anterior
expanded portion of the axial skeleton. It has a longitudinal
axis, the <b>craniofacial</b> axis around which the various
parts are arranged, and this axis is a direct continuation of
that of the vertebral column. Similarly the cavity of the
cranium is a direct continuation of the spinal canal. The
posterior part of the craniofacial axis, which has relations
only with the cranium, is called the <b>basicranial axis</b>.</p>

<p>In the dog as in the other types previously described, the
skull in its earliest stages is cartilaginous, containing no bone.
In the adult, however, the cartilage is to a great extent
replaced by bone, and in addition to this cartilage bone,
membrane bone is largely developed, and intimately united
with the cartilage bone to form one complete whole.</p>

<p>In the description of the dog's skeleton, as in those of the
previous types, the names of the membrane bones are printed
in italics, while those of the cartilage bones are printed in
thick type.</p>

<p>Most of the numerous foramina perforating the skull
walls will be described after the bones have been dealt with.</p>

<p>For purposes of description the cranium may be further
subdivided into:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The cranium proper or brain case.</p>

<p>2. The sense capsules.</p>

<p>3. The upper jaw.</p>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Cranium Proper or Brain Case.</span></p>

<p>Taking the membrane and cartilage bones together, they
are seen to be more or less arranged in three segments, which
however must not be regarded as homologous with the segments
forming the vertebral column.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The <b>occipital segment</b> is the most posterior of the three,
and consists of four cartilage bones, which in the adult are
commonly completely fused together. They surround the great<b>foramen magnum</b> (fig. 75, 2) through which the brain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
spinal cord communicate. Forming the lower margin of the
foramen magnum is a large flat unpaired bone, the <b>basi-occipital</b>
(fig. 75, 5). Above this on each side are the <b>exoccipitals</b>,
whose sides are drawn out into a pair of downwardly-directed
<b>paroccipital processes</b>, which are applied
to the tympanic bullae<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. The inner side of each exoccipital is
converted into the large rounded <b>occipital condyle</b> (fig. 72,
13) by which the skull articulates with the atlas vertebra. The
dorsal boundary of the foramen magnum is formed by a large
unpaired flat bone, the <b>supra-occipital</b> (figs. 72 and 75, 1),
which is continuous with a small bone, the <i>interparietal</i>, prolonged
forwards between the parietal bones of the next segment.</p>

<p>In old animals the interparietal forms the hind part of a
prominent ridge running along the mid-dorsal surface of the
skull and called the <b>sagittal crest</b>, while the junction line of
the occipital and parietal segments forms a prominent <b>occipital
crest</b>.</p>

<p>The plane in which the bones of the occipital segment lie
is called the occipital plane; the angle that it makes with the
basicranial axis varies much in different mammals.</p>

<p>The <b>parietal segment</b> consists of both cartilage and
membrane bones. It is formed of five bones, which are in
contact with those of the occipital segment on the dorsal and
ventral surfaces, while laterally they are separated by the interposition
of the auditory bones, and to some extent of the squamosal.
The <b>basisphenoid</b> (fig. 75, 6), an unpaired bone
forming the ventral member of this segment, is the direct
continuation of the basi-occipital. It tapers anteriorly, but is
rather deep vertically, its upper or dorsal surface bearing a
depression, the <b>sella turcica</b>, which lodges the pituitary body
of the brain. From the sides of the basisphenoid arise the
<b>alisphenoids</b> (fig. 75, 11) a pair of bones of irregular shape
generally described as wing-like; each gives off from its lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
surface a <b>pterygoid plate</b>, which is united in front with the
palatine, and below with the pterygoid. The alisphenoids are
united above with a pair of large nearly square bones, the
<i>parietals</i> (fig. 73, 2), which meet one another in the mid-dorsal
line. The line of junction is frequently drawn out into a strong
ridge, which forms the anterior part of the <b>sagittal crest</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>frontal segment</b>, which surrounds the anterior part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of the brain, is closely connected along almost its whole
posterior border with the parietal segment.</p>

<p>Its base is formed by the <b>presphenoid</b> (fig. 75, 12), a
very deep unpaired bone, narrow and compressed ventrally,
and with an irregular dorsal surface. The presphenoid is
continuous with a second pair of wing-like bones, the <b>orbitosphenoids</b>.
Each orbitosphenoid meets the alisphenoid
behind, but the relations of the parts in this region are
somewhat obscured by a number of large foramina piercing
the bones, and also by an irregular vacuity, the <b>foramen
lacerum anterius</b> or <b>sphenoidal fissure</b>, which lies between
the orbitosphenoid and alisphenoid, separating the lateral parts
of the parietal and frontal segments, in the same way as the
space occupied by the auditory bones separates the lateral
parts of the occipital and parietal segments. The orbitosphenoids
pass obliquely forwards and upwards, and are united
above with a second pair of large membrane bones, the <i>frontals</i>
(fig. 73, 3). The outer side of each frontal is drawn out into
a rather prominent rounded <b>postorbital process</b> (fig. 73, 10),
from which a ridge converges backwards to meet the sagittal
crest. The anterior part of the frontal is produced to form
the long nasal process, which is wedged in between the nasal
and maxillae.</p>

<p>The cranial cavity is continuous in front with the <b>nasal</b> or
<b>olfactory cavities</b>, but the passage is partially closed by a
screen of bone, the <b>cribriform plate</b> (fig. 72, 5), which is
placed obliquely across the anterior end of the cranial cavity,
and is perforated by a number of holes through which the
olfactory nerves pass. The plane of the cribriform plate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
called the <b>ethmoidal plane</b>, and as was the case also with
the occipital plane, the angle that it makes with the basicranial
axis varies much in different mammals, and is of
importance. The <b>olfactory fossa</b> in which lie the olfactory
lobes of the brain, is partially separated from the <b>cerebral
fossa</b>, or cavity occupied by the cerebral hemispheres, by
ridges on the orbitosphenoids and frontals. The presphenoid
is connected in front with a vertical plate formed partly of bone,
partly of unossified cartilage; this plate, the <b>mesethmoid</b>
(fig. 72, 7), separates the two olfactory cavities which lodge
the olfactory organs. Its anterior end always remains unossified,
and forms the septal cartilage of the nose.</p>

<p>The brain case may then, to use the words of Sir W.H.
Flower, be described as a tube dilated in the middle and composed
of three bony rings or segments, with an aperture at each
end, and a fissure or space at the sides between each of them.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Sense capsules.</span></p>

<p>Each of the three special sense organs, of hearing, of sight,
and of smell, is in the embryo provided with a cartilaginous
or membranous protecting capsule; and two of these, the
auditory and olfactory capsules, become afterwards more or
less ossified, and intimately related to the cranium proper.</p>


<p>(1) <b>Bones in relation to the Auditory capsules.</b></p>

<p>These bones lie on each side wedged into the vacuity between
the lateral parts of the occipital and parietal segments;
they are three in number, the <b>periotic</b>, the <i>tympanic</i> and the
<i>squamosal</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>periotic</b> is the most important of them, as it replaces
the cartilaginous auditory capsule of the embryo, and encloses
the essential organ of hearing. It commences to ossify
from three centres corresponding to the pro-otic, epi-otic and
opisthotic of lower skulls, such as those of the Turtle and
Crocodile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>These ossifications however very early combine to form a
single bone, the <b>periotic</b>, which nevertheless consists of two
portions, the <b>petrous</b> and the <b>mastoid</b>, differing considerably
from one another.</p>

<p>The <b>petrous portion</b> lies dorsally and anteriorly, and is
much the more important of the two, as it encloses the
essential part of the auditory organ. It forms an irregular
mass of hard dense bone, projecting into the cranial cavity,
and does not appear on the external surface at all. The
<b>mastoid portion</b> lies ventrally and posteriorly, is smaller,
and formed of less dense bone than is the petrous portion,
from which it differs also in the fact that it appears on the
surface of the skull, just external to the exoccipital. The
petrous portion bears a ridge, which together with a ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
on the supra-occipital, and the <b>tentorium</b> (fig. 72, 21), a
transverse fold of the dura mater<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, separates the large cerebral
fossa from the <b>cerebellar fossa</b>, which is much smaller than
the cerebral fossa and lies behind and partly beneath it. The
plane of the tentorium is called the <b>tentorial plane</b>, and the
angles that it makes with the basicranial axis and with the
occipital and ethmoidal planes vary much in different mammals.</p>

<p>The periotic has its inner surface marked by important
depressions, while both inner and outer surfaces are pierced
by foramina. At about the middle of its inner surface are
seen two deep pits, one lying immediately above the other.
Of these the more ventral is a foramen, the <b>internal auditory
meatus</b> (fig. 72, 20), through which the VIIth (facial)
and VIIIth (auditory) nerves leave the cranial cavity, the
facial nerve passing through the bone and afterwards leaving
the skull by the <b>stylomastoid foramen</b> (fig. 75, VII), while
the auditory passes to the inner ear. The more dorsal of the
two pits is not a foramen but the <b>floccular fossa</b> (fig. 72, 23)
which lodges the floccular lobe of the cerebellum. In some
skulls another wide and shallow but fairly prominent depression
is seen dorsal to and slightly behind the floccular fossa,
this also lodges part of the cerebellum. Behind the internal
auditory meatus, between the periotic and exoccipital is seen
the internal opening of the <b>foramen lacerum posterius</b>
(fig. 72, 22). The shape of this opening varies. The ventro-anterior
border of the periotic is marked by a deep notch, the
sides of which sometimes unite, converting it into a foramen.</p>

<p>On the outer side of the periotic, and clearly seen only
after the removal of the tympanic, are two holes, the <b>fenestra
ovalis</b> and the <b>fenestra rotunda</b>.</p>

<p>The <i>tympanic</i> (figs. 72, 15 and 75, 4) is a greatly expanded
boat-shaped bone, which forms the auditory bulla and lies
immediately ventral to the periotic; it is separated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
periotic by the <b>tympanic cavity</b> into which the fenestra
rotunda and the fenestra ovalis open.</p>

<p>There are several other openings into the tympanic cavity.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) On the external surface is a large oval opening, the
<b>external auditory meatus</b> bounded by a thickened rim.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Into the outer and anterior part of the cavity the
outer end of the <b>Eustachian tube</b> opens; while the inner
end passes through a foramen (fig. 75, 22) just external to the
foramen lacerum medium, on its way to open into the pharynx.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The internal carotid artery also enters the tympanic
cavity by a canal which commences in the foramen lacerum
posterius, and passes forwards to open on the inner side of the
bulla. The artery then passes forwards, and barely appearing
on the ventral surface of the cranium, enters the brain cavity
through the foramen lacerum medium (fig. 75, 9).</p>

<p>Immediately behind the tympanic, between it and the
mastoid process of the periotic and the paroccipital process of
the exoccipital is the <b>stylomastoid foramen</b> (fig. 75, <ins class="edcorr" title="p. 393, middle of page, for VIII read VII">VII</ins>).</p>

<p>Within the tympanic cavity are four small bones, the
<b>auditory ossicles</b> (cp. fig. 74), called respectively the <b>malleus</b>,
<b>incus</b>, <b>lenticular</b> and <b>stapes</b>; these together form a
chain extending from the fenestra ovalis to the tympanic
membrane.</p>

<p>The <b>malleus</b> has a somewhat rounded head (fig. 100, B, 1)
which articulates with the incus, while the other end of the
bone is drawn out into a long process, the <b>manubrium</b>,
which lies in relation to the tympanic membrane. The head
is also more or less connected by a thin plate of bone, the
<b>lamella</b>, to another outgrowth, the <b>processus longus</b>. The
<b>incus</b> (fig. 100, B, 3) is somewhat anvil-shaped, and is drawn
out into a process which is connected with the <b>lenticular</b>, a
nodule of bone interposed between the incus and the stapes,
with which it early becomes united. The <b>stapes</b> (fig. 100, B, 2)
is stirrup-shaped, consisting of a basal portion from which
arise two <b>crura</b>, which meet and enclose a space, the <b>canal</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>squamosal</i> (fig. 73, 7) is a large bone occupying much
of the side wall of the cranial cavity, and articulating above
with the parietal, and behind with the supra-occipital, while
in front it overlaps the frontal and alisphenoid. But though it
occupies so large a space on the outer wall, it forms very
little of the internal wall of the skull, but is really like a bony
plate attached to the outer surface of the cranial wall. The
squamosal is drawn out into a strong forwardly-directed <b>zygomatic
process</b> which meets the jugal or malar. The ventral
side of the zygomatic process is hollowed out, forming the
<b>glenoid fossa</b> (fig. 75, 8), a smooth laterally elongated surface
with which the lower jaw articulates, while the hinder edge of
the glenoid fossa is drawn out into a rounded <b>postglenoid
process</b> (fig. 75, 23). The articulation is such as to allow
but little lateral play of the lower jaw.</p>


<p class="cen">(2) <b>Bones in relation to the Optic capsules.</b></p>

<p>The only bone developed in relation to the optic capsule
on each side is the <i>lachrymal</i>. This is a small membrane
bone lying between the frontal and palatine behind, and the
maxillae and jugal in front. It is perforated by a prominent
<b>lachrymal foramen</b> (fig. 73, 13) which opens within the
orbit.</p>


<p class="cen">(3) <b>Bones in relation to the Olfactory capsules.</b></p>

<p>In connection with the <b>olfactory capsules</b>, five pairs of
bones are developed, two pairs being membrane bones, and
three pairs cartilage bones.</p>

<p>Of membrane bones, the <i>nasals</i> (fig. 73, 4) are a pair of
long narrow bones, lying closely side by side, and forming
the main part of the roof of the olfactory chamber. Their
posterior ends overlap the frontals, and the outer margin of
each is in contact with the nasal process of the frontal, and
with the maxillae and premaxillae.</p>

<p>Lying immediately ventral to the nasals, and on each
side of the perpendicular mesethmoid, are the <b>ethmoid</b> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
<b>turbinal</b> bones, which have a curious character, being formed
of a number of delicate plates intimately folded on one
another. The posterior pair of these bones, the <b>ethmo-turbinals</b>
(fig. 72, 10), are the larger, and form a mass of
intricately folded lamellae attached behind to the cribriform
plate, and passing laterally into two thin plates of bone,
which abut on the maxillae. The uppermost lamella of each
ethmo-turbinal is larger than the others and more distinct.
It is sometimes distinguished as the <b>naso-turbinal</b>, and forms
an imperfect lower boundary to a canal, which is bounded
above by the nasals. In front of and somewhat below the
ethmo-turbinals, lie another pair of bones of similar character,
the <b>maxillo-turbinals</b> (fig. 72, 11).</p>

<p>The last bone to be mentioned in connection with the
olfactory capsules is a membrane bone, the <i>vomer</i> (fig. 72, 9).
This is a slender vertically-placed bone, whose anterior part lies
between the maxillo-turbinals, while behind it extends beyond
the mesethmoid, so as to underlie the anterior part of the presphenoid.
The anterior part of the vomer forms a kind of
trough, while further back in the region of the ethmo-turbinals
it sends out a pair of strong lateral plates, each of which,
passing below the ethmo-turbinal, joins the side wall of the
nasal cavity, and forms a partition dividing the nasal
cavity into a lower <b>narial passage</b> and an upper <b>olfactory

<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Upper jaw.</span></p>

<p>The bones of the upper jaw are closely connected with
those of the cranium proper and olfactory capsules. The most
posterior of them is the <i>pterygoid</i> (fig. 75, 15), a thin vertically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
placed plate of bone, which articulates above with the
basisphenoid, the presphenoid, and the strong pterygoid process
of the alisphenoid. The ventral end of the pterygoid
is drawn out into a small backwardly-projecting <b>hamular
process</b>. In front the pterygoid articulates with the <i>palatine</i>,
a much larger bone, consisting of (1) a vertical portion, which
passes up to meet the orbitosphenoid and frontal, and sends
inwards a plate which meets the presphenoid and vomer, forming
much of the roof of the posterior part of the narial passage;
and (2) a strong horizontal portion, the <b>palatal process</b> (fig.
75, 16), which passes inwards and meets its fellow in the
middle line, forming the posterior part of the bridge of bone
supporting the hard palate. The palatal process is continuous
in front, with a large bone, the <i>maxillae</i>, which, like the palatine,
consists of vertical and horizontal portions. The vertical,
or <b>facial portion</b> (fig. 73, 5), is the largest, and constitutes
the main part of the side of the face in front of the orbit, forming
also the chief part of the outer wall of the nasal cavity.
It is continuous in front with the premaxillae, above with the
nasal and frontal, and behind with the lachrymal, jugal, and
palatine. The horizontal, or <b>palatal portion</b> (fig. 75, 17),
forms the anterior part of the bony plate supporting the hard
palate, and meets its fellow in a long straight symphysis. The
junction line between the palatal and facial portions is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the <b>alveolar border</b>, and along it are attached the canine,
premolar, and molar teeth.</p>

<p>The anterior part of the upper jaw on each side is formed
by a small bone, the <i>premaxillae</i>, which bears the incisor teeth.
It, like the maxillae, has a palatal portion (fig. 75, 20), which
meets its fellow in the middle line, and an ascending portion,
which passes backwards as the <b>nasal process</b>, tapering regularly
and lying between the nasal and the maxillae. The two
premaxillae form the outer and lower borders of the anterior
nares. The last bone to be mentioned in connection with the
upper jaw and face is the <i>jugal</i> or <i>malar</i> (figs. 73, 8, and 75, 14),
a strong bone which forms the anterior half of the zygomatic
arch. It is firmly united in front to the maxillae, and behind
meets the zygomatic process of the squamosal, being drawn
out dorsally into a short <b>postorbital process</b> at the point of
meeting. This process lies immediately below the postorbital
process of the frontal, and if the two met, as they do in some
mammals, they would partially shut off the orbit from a larger
posterior cavity, the <b>temporal fossa</b>. In the living animal a
ligament unites the two postorbital processes.</p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">The Lower jaw or Mandible.</span></p>

<p>This consists of two elongated symmetrical halves, the
<b>rami</b>, which are united to one another at the median
symphysis in front, while behind they diverge considerably,
and each articulates with the glenoid surface of the corresponding
squamosal. In young animals the rami are united at
the symphysis by fibrous tissue, but in old animals they sometimes
become fused together. The upper or alveolar border
bears the teeth, and behind them is drawn out into a high
laterally compressed <b>coronoid process</b> (fig. 72, 24), which is
hollowed on its outer surface. Immediately behind the coronoid
process is the transversely elongated <b>condyle</b> (fig. 72, 25),
which fits into the glenoid cavity in such a way as to allow
free up and down movement of the jaw, with but little rolling
motion. The posterior end of the jaw below the condyle forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
a short rounded process, the <b>angle</b> (fig. 72, 26). Two prominent
foramina are to be seen in the lower jaw. These are
firstly the <b>inferior dental foramen</b> (fig. 72, 28), which lies
on the inner surface below the coronoid process; through it
an artery and a branch of the fifth nerve enter to supply the
teeth, and secondly the <b>mental foramen</b>, which lies on the
outer side near the anterior end, and through which a branch
of the same nerve emerges.</p>


<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">The Hyoid.</span></p>

<p>The <b>Hyoid</b> of the dog consists of a transverse median
piece, the <b>basi-hyal</b>[1] (fig. 72, 32), from which arise two pairs of
<b>cornua</b>. The <b>anterior cornu</b> is much the longer of the two,
and consists principally of three short separate ossifications,
placed end to end and called respectively the <b>cerato-hyal</b><a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>,
<b>epi-hyal</b>, and <b>stylo-hyal</b>. All of them are short rods of bone,
contracted in the middle, and expanded at the ends, where they
are tipped with cartilage. The cerato-hyal (fig. 72, 31) lies next
to the basi hyal. The stylo-hyal is terminated by a much smaller
bone, the <b>tympano-hyal</b>, which lies in a canal between the
tympanic and periotic, and is ankylosed to the periotic just
to the anterior and inner side of the stylomastoid foramen.</p>

<p>The <b>posterior cornu</b> of the hyoid is much smaller than
the anterior; it consists of a short bone, the <b>thyro-hyal</b> (fig.
72, 33), which connects the basi-hyal with the thyroid cartilage
of the larynx.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foramina of the skull.</span></p>

<p>The foramina, or apertures perforating the walls of the
skull, are very numerous, and may either be due to holes
actually penetrating the bone, or may be small vacuities
between the margins of two elsewhere contiguous bones.</p>

<p>They may be divided into two groups, the first including</p>

<p>I. The holes through which the <b>twelve cranial nerves</b>
leave the cranial cavity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p><i>a.</i> The most anterior of these nerves, the olfactory, leaves
the skull by a number of small holes piercing the <b>cribriform
plate</b> (fig. 72, 5).</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The second, or optic, passes out by a large hole, the
<b>optic foramen</b> (fig. 75, II) piercing the orbitosphenoid. The
optic foramen is the most anterior of the three prominent
holes seen within and immediately behind the orbit.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The third, fourth, and sixth nerves, i.e. those supplying
the eye muscles, and with them the first or ophthalmic branch
of the large fifth or trigeminal nerve, pass out by a large hole,
the <b>foramen lacerum anterius</b> (fig. 75, III, IV, V<sub>1</sub>, VI),
which, as has been already mentioned, lies between the
orbitosphenoid and alisphenoid.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Immediately behind the foramen lacerum anterius, the
alisphenoid is perforated by a prominent round hole, the
<b>foramen rotundum</b> (fig. 75, V<sub>2</sub>), through which the second
branch of the trigeminal nerve passes out.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> A quarter of an inch further back there is another
prominent hole, the <b>foramen ovale</b> (fig. 75, V<sub>3</sub>), through
which the third branch of the trigeminal nerve leaves the
cranium.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> The seventh or facial nerve, as already mentioned,
leaves the cranial cavity and enters the auditory capsule,
through an opening in the periotic called the <b>internal
auditory meatus</b>, while it finally leaves the skull by the
<b>stylomastoid foramen</b> (fig. 75, VII), which lies between
the tympanic bulla, the paroccipital process, and the mastoid
portion of the periotic.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> The eighth or auditory nerve on leaving the cranial
cavity, passes with the facial straight into the auditory capsule
through the <b>internal auditory meatus</b> (fig. 72, 20). It is
then distributed to the organ of hearing.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> The ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves leave the skull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
through the <b>foramen lacerum posterius</b> (fig. 75, IX, X,
XI), a large space lying between the auditory bones and the
exoccipital.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> Finally, the twelfth nerve, the hypoglossal, passes out
through the prominent <b>condylar foramen</b> (fig. 75, XII),
which perforates the exoccipital just behind the foramen
lacerum posterius.</p>


<p>II. <span class="smcap">Other Openings in the Skull.</span></p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <b>anterior narial opening</b> lies at the anterior end
of the skull, and is bounded by the premaxillae and nasals.
In the natural condition it is divided into two by a vertical
partition, formed by the <b>narial septum</b>, the anterior unossified
part of the mesethmoid.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Penetrating the middle of the maxillae at the side of
the face is the rather large <b>infra-orbital foramen</b> (fig. 73, 11),
through which part of the second branch of the trigeminal
nerve passes out from the orbit to the side of the face.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Several foramina are seen perforating the anterior part
of the orbit. The most dorsal of these, perforating the lachrymal
bone, is the <b>lachrymal foramen</b> (fig. 73, 13). Lying
below and slightly external to this is a large foramen, through
which part of the second branch of the trigeminal enters on
its way to the infra-orbital foramen and so to the side of the
face. Lastly, lying below these, and perforating the palatine,
are two closely apposed foramina, the <b>internal orbital
foramina</b>, through which part of the first or ophthalmic
branch of the trigeminal nerve leaves the orbit, passing into
the nasal cavity.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The anterior part of the palate between the premaxillae
and the maxillae is perforated by a pair of long closely apposed
apertures, the <b>anterior palatine foramina</b> (fig. 75, 19).
They transmit part of the trigeminal nerve.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Towards the posterior part of the palate are two pairs
of small <b>posterior palatine foramina</b> (fig. 75, 18). These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
perforate the palatine and transmit branches of the trigeminal
nerve and certain blood-vessels.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> The <b>posterior narial opening</b> is bounded chiefly by
the palatines.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> The <b>alisphenoid canal</b> (fig. 75, 21) is a short canal
penetrating the base of the alisphenoid bone, and transmitting
the external carotid artery. It lies between the foramen
rotundum and the foramen ovale.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> Between the auditory bulla and the foramen ovale are
seen two openings. The more external of these is the opening
of the <b>Eustachian canal</b> (fig. 75, 22), which communicates
with the tympanic cavity. The more internal is the <b>foramen
lacerum medium</b> (fig. 75, 9), through which the internal
carotid enters the cranial cavity.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> The <b>external auditory aperture</b> (fig. 75, 7) is a large
opening with rough edges at the outer side of the tympanic bulla.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> Between it and the glenoid surface of the squamosal is
the <b>postglenoid</b> foramen (fig. 75, 10) through which a vein
passes out.</p>

<p><i>k.</i> Lastly, there is the great <b>foramen magnum</b> (fig. 75, 2),
between the occipital condyles. Through it the brain and
spinal cord communicate.</p>


<p>C. <span class="smcap">The Ribs and Sternum.</span></p>

<p>These, together with the thoracic vertebrae, form the
skeletal framework of the thorax. Each rib is a curved rod,
which at its dorsal end is movably articulated to the vertebra,
and at its ventral end is either connected with the sternum, or
ends freely. In the dog there are thirteen pairs of ribs, nine
pairs of which are directly connected with the sternum, while
the remaining four end freely and are known as <b>floating ribs</b>.
Each rib is obviously divided into two parts, a dorsal or <b>vertebral
part</b>, and a ventral or <b>sternal part</b>. The vertebral
portion, which forms about two-thirds of the whole rib, is a
flattened, regularly curved rod, completely ossified. Its dorsal<span class="pagenum">[403]</span>
end is rounded, forming the <b>head</b> or <b>capitulum</b>, which
articulates with a concave surface furnished partly by the corresponding
vertebra and partly by the vertebra next in front.
The last three or four however articulate with one vertebra
only. A short way behind the capitulum on the dorsal side of
the rib is a rounded outgrowth, the <b>tubercle</b> or <b>tuberculum</b>,
by means of which the rib articulates with the transverse
process. The portion of the rib between the head and the
tubercle is known as the <b>neck</b>. The <b>sternal portion</b> of the
rib (fig. 76) is a short bar of calcified or imperfectly ossified
cartilage, about one-third of the length of the corresponding
bony portion. The anterior sternal ribs are somewhat more
cartilaginous than the posterior ones. The vertebral portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
increase in length from the first which is very stout, and has
the capitulum and tuberculum very distinct, to about the
eighth or ninth; afterwards they gradually diminish in size.
The first nine to eleven have the capitula and tubercula separate,
afterwards they gradually merge together.</p>

</table></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sternum.</span></p>

<p>This is an elongated cylindrical structure lying in the mid-ventral
wall of the thorax, and is divided into eight segments
or <b>sternebrae</b>. The anterior segment, the <b>presternum</b>
(fig. 76, 1) or <b>manubrium sterni</b> is expanded in front; the
next six segments, which, together form the <b>mesosternum</b>
are elongated, somewhat contracted in the middle and expanded
at the ends. The last segment or <b>xiphisternum</b>
(fig. 76, 4) is long and narrow, and terminates in a flattened
expanded plate of cartilage. The first pair of sternal ribs
articulate with the sides of the presternum, and the remaining
pairs between the successive sternebrae. Between the last
sternebra and the xiphisternum two pairs articulate. Development
shows that the sternum is formed by the union
in the middle line of two lateral portions; this can be well
seen in the presternum and xiphisternum of the puppy, but no
traces of this median division remain in the adult dog.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>

<p>The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the
anterior and posterior limbs, and of their respective supports,
the pectoral and pelvic girdles.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The <b>pectoral girdle</b> lies external to the ribs, and has no
bony attachment to the axial skeleton. In almost all
Mammalia it is, as compared with that in Sauropsids, very
incomplete; and in the dog it is even more reduced than in
the majority of Mammalia. The dorsal portion or <b>scapula</b> is
well developed, but the ventral portion is almost entirely absent.</p>

<p>The <b>scapula</b> is somewhat triangular in shape, the apex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
being directed downwards and forwards, and being expanded
to form the shallow <b>glenoid cavity</b> with which the head of
the humerus articulates. The inner surface of the scapula is
nearly flat, while the outer is drawn out into a very prominent
ridge, the <b>spine</b>, which, arising gradually near the dorsal end,
runs downwards, dividing the surface into two nearly equal
parts, the <b>prescapular</b> and <b>postscapular fossae</b>, and ends
in a short blunt process, the <b>acromion</b>. The anterior border
of the scapula is somewhat curved, and is called the <b>coracoid
border</b>; it is terminated ventrally by a slight blunt swelling,
the <b>coracoid process</b>, which ossifies from a different centre
from the rest of the scapula, and is probably the sole representative
of the <b>coracoid</b>. The dorsal or <b>suprascapular
border</b> of the scapula is rounded, while the posterior or
<b>glenoid border</b> is nearly straight. The clavicle<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> or collar
bone, which in a large proportion of mammals is well seen, in
the dog is very imperfectly developed; it is short and broad,
and is suspended in the muscles, not reaching either the
scapula or sternum.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Anterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>The anterior limb of the dog is divisible into the usual
three portions, the <b>brachium</b> or <b>upper arm</b>, the <b>antibrachium</b>
or <b>fore-arm</b>, and the <b>manus</b> or <b>wrist</b> and <b>hand</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>brachium</b> or <b>upper arm</b> includes only a single bone,
the <b>humerus</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>humerus</b> is a stout elongated bone, articulating by
its large proximal <b>head</b> (fig. 77, 1) with the glenoid cavity of
the scapula, and at its distal end by the <b>trochlea</b> with the
bones of the fore-arm. The head passes on its inner side into
an area roughened for the attachment of muscles and called
the <b>lesser tuberosity</b> (fig. 77, 2); while in front it is divided
by the shallow <b>bicipital groove</b> from a large roughened area,
the <b>greater tuberosity</b> (fig. 77, 3), which is continued as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
slight roughened ridge, extending about one-third of the way
down the outer side of the shaft. This ridge, which in many
animals is much more strongly developed than it is in the dog,
is called the <b>deltoid ridge</b>. The <b>trochlea</b> (fig. 77, 5) at the
distal end of the bone is a pulley-like surface, elevated at
the sides and grooved in the middle. It articulates with the
radius and ulna of the fore-arm. On each side of it are slight
roughened projections, the <b>internal</b> and <b>external condyles</b>
(fig. 77, 7). In the cat and many other animals there is a
foramen, the <b>ent-epicondylar foramen</b> above the internal
condyle, but in the dog this is not developed. Passing up
the shaft from the external condyle is a slight ridge, the <b>supinator</b>
or <b>ectocondylar ridge</b>; this is better developed in
many mammals. Immediately above the trochlea in front
and behind are the deep <b>supra-trochlear fossae</b>, which
communicate with one another through the <b>supra-trochlear
foramen</b> (fig. 77, 8). The posterior of these, the <b>olecranon
fossa</b>, is much the deeper, and receives the olecranon process
of the ulna when the arm is extended. The head and
tuberosities of the humerus ossify from one centre, the shaft
from a second, and the trochlea and condyles from a third.</p>

<p>The <b>fore-arm</b> or <b>antibrachium</b> contains two bones,
the <b>radius</b> and <b>ulna</b>; they are immovably articulated with
one another, but not fused. The pre-axial bone, the <b>radius</b>
(fig. 77, B), which lies more or less in front of the ulna, is
external to the ulna at its proximal end, and at its distal end is
internal to that bone. It articulates with the external portion
of the trochlea, while the ulna articulates with the internal
portion. It is a straight bone with its distal end slightly larger
than its proximal end. The proximal end articulates with the
trochlea, the distal end with the bones of the carpus.</p>

<p>The postaxial bone, the <b>ulna</b> (fig. 77, C), has the proximal
end much enlarged, forming the <b>olecranon</b> (fig. 77, 11), and
tapers gradually to the distal end. Near its proximal end
the ulna is marked by a deep <b>sigmoid notch</b>, which bears<span class="pagenum">[407]</span>
on its inner side a concave surface (fig. 77, 12) for articulation
with the trochlea. The pointed proximal end of the sigmoid
notch is called the <b>coronoid process</b>. Somewhat in front
of and below the sigmoid notch is a smaller hollow (fig. 77, 13),
with which the radius articulates.</p>

<p>In the young animal the ends of both radius and ulna are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
seen to ossify from centres different from those forming the
shafts. The epiphyses forming both ends of the radius, and the
distal end of the ulna are large, while that at the proximal end
of the ulna is small, and forms only the end of the olecranon.</p>

<p>The <b>Manus</b> is divided into</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <b>carpus</b> or <b>wrist</b>, formed of a group of small
bones.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <b>hand</b>, which includes firstly some elongated
bones, the <b>metacarpals</b>, forming what corresponds to the
palm of the hand, and secondly the phalanges, which form the
<b>fingers</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Carpus</b> or <b>wrist</b>. The carpus of the dog consists of
seven small bones, arranged in a proximal row of three, and
a distal row of four. It differs much from the simpler type
met with in the newt. The largest bone of the proximal row
is the <b>scapho-lunar</b> (fig. 80, 1), formed by the fused <b>scaphoid</b>
(radiale), <b>lunar</b> (intermedium), and <b>centrale</b>; it has a large
convex proximal surface for articulation with the radius, and
articulates distally with the trapezium, trapezoid, and magnum,
and internally with the cuneiform. The <b>cuneiform</b> (ulnare)
(fig. 80, 2) has a posterior rounded surface articulating with
the ulna; it articulates in front with the unciform, and internally
with the <b>pisiform</b> (fig. 80, 7), which is a comparatively
large sesamoid bone on the ulnar side of the carpus.
Frequently also there is a small sesamoid bone on the radial
side of the carpus. The <b>trapezium</b> (carpale 1), <b>trapezoid</b>
(carpale 2), and <b>magnum</b> (carpale 3) (fig. 80, 5) are all small
bones, and support respectively the first, second, and third
metacarpals. The <b>unciform</b> (carpalia 4 and 5) (fig. 80, 6)
is larger, and supports the fourth and fifth metacarpals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The hand has five <b>digits</b>, each consisting of an elongated
<b>metacarpal</b>, followed by <b>phalanges</b>, the last of which, the
<b>ungual phalanx</b>, is pointed and curved, and bears the claw.
Each of the metacarpals is seen in the young animal to have
its distal end formed by a prominent epiphysis, and each of
the phalanges, except those bearing the claws, has a similar
epiphysis at its proximal end.</p>

<p>The <b>pollex</b> (fig. 80, A, I ) is far shorter than the other digits,
and normally does not touch the ground in walking. It has
only two phalanges, while each of the other digits has three.
A pair of small sesamoid bones are developed on the ventral or
flexor side of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations of all the
digits except the pollex. Frequently similar sesamoid bones
occur also on the dorsal side of the phalangeal articulations.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The <b>pelvic girdle</b> consists of two halves, which lie nearly
parallel to the vertebral column.</p>

<p>Each half is firmly united to its fellow in a ventral
symphysis behind, and is in front expanded and united to the
sacrum. Each half or <b>innominate bone</b> is seen in the young
animal to consist of four distinct parts, the <b>ilium</b> or dorsal
element, the <b>pubis</b> or anterior ventral element, the <b>ischium</b>
or posterior ventral element, and a small fourth part, the
<b>acetabular</b> or <b>cotyloid</b> bone, wedged in between the three
others. These parts, though all distinct in the young animal,
are in the adult so completely fused that their respective
boundaries cannot be distinguished. At about the middle of
the outer surface of the innominate bone is a very deep cavity,
the <b>acetabulum</b> (fig. 78, A, 1) with which the head of the
femur articulates; all the bones except the pubis take part
in its formation.</p>

<p>The <b>ilium</b> is a rather long bone, expanded in front and
contracted behind; it forms about half the acetabulum. On
its inner or <b>sacral surface</b> (fig. 78, 4) is a large roughened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
patch for articulation with the sacrum; its outer or <b>gluteal
surface</b> is concave. The posterior part of the bone is flattened
below, forming the narrow <b>iliac surface</b> (fig. 78, A, 5).</p>

<p>The <b>ischium</b> (fig. 78, 9) is a wide flattened bone forming
the posterior part of the innominate bone. It meets the
pubis ventrally, but is separated from it for the greater part
of its length by the large <b>obturator</b> or <b>thyroid foramen</b>
(fig. 78, 2). At its posterior end externally it bears a rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
prominent roughened <b>ischial tuberosity</b> (fig. 78, A, 10).
The ischium meets its fellow in a ventral symphysis, and
forms about one-third of the acetabulum.</p>

<p>The <b>pubis</b> (fig. 78, 12) is smaller than either the ischium
or ilium; it does not take part in the formation of the acetabulum,
and like the ischium, meets its fellow in a ventral
symphysis. The <b>acetabular bone</b> (fig, 78, B, 14) is small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and triangular, and is wedged in between the other three. It
forms about one-sixth of the acetabulum.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Posterior Limb.</span></p>

<p>The <b>posterior limb</b>, like the anterior, is divisible into three
parts; these are the <b>thigh</b>, the <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b>, and the <b>pes</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>thigh</b> contains only a single bone, the <b>femur</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>femur</b> is a long straight bone with a nearly smooth
shaft and expanded ends. The proximal end bears on its
inner side the large rounded <b>head</b> (fig. 79, A, 1) which
articulates with the acetabulum. External to the head and
divided from it by a deep pit is a large rough outgrowth,
the <b>great trochanter</b> (fig. 79, 3). The deep pit is the
<b>trochanteric</b> or <b>digital fossa</b>. On the inner side below the
head is a smaller roughened surface, the <b>lesser trochanter</b>.
The lower or distal end of the bone bears two prominent
rounded surfaces, the <b>condyles</b>, which articulate with the
tibia. They are separated from one another by the deep
<b>intercondylar notch</b>, which is continued above and in front
as a shallow groove, lodging a large sesamoid bone, the <b>patella</b>
or <b>knee-cap</b>. At the back of the knee-joint are a pair of
smaller sesamoids, the <b>fabellae</b> (fig. 79, 7).</p>

<p>In the young animal there are three epiphyses to the shaft
of the femur, one forming the head, one the great trochanter,
and one the distal end.</p>

<p>The <b>crus</b> or <b>shin</b> contains two bones, the <b>tibia</b> and
<b>fibula</b>. The <b>tibia</b> is a fairly thick straight bone, expanded
at both ends, especially at the head or proximal end. The
proximal end is triangular in cross section, and bears two facets
for articulation with the condyles of the femur. The anterior
surface of the proximal end of the tibia is marked by the
strong <b>cnemial crest</b> (fig. 79, 8), which runs some way down
the shaft. The distal end of the tibia articulates with the
astragalus by an irregular, somewhat square surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The shaft of the tibia ossifies from one centre, the distal end
from a second, and the proximal end from two more.</p>

<p>The <b>fibula</b> (fig. 79, C) is a distinct but very slender bone,
somewhat expanded at both ends. It lies external to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
tibia and articulates by its proximal end with the head of the
tibia, and by its distal end with the calcaneum. Its shaft
and proximal end ossify from one centre, and its distal end
from a second.</p>


<p>The <b>Pes</b>.</p>

<p>The structure of the <b>pes</b> corresponds closely with that of
the manus. It is divided into:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <b>tarsus</b> or <b>ankle</b> formed of a group of small
bones.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <b>foot</b>, which includes, firstly, some elongated bones,
the <b>metatarsals</b>, forming what corresponds to the sole of
the foot, and secondly the <b>phalanges</b>, which form the toes.</p>

<p>The <b>Tarsus</b>. The tarsus of the dog consists of seven bones
arranged in two rows, of two and four respectively, with a
<b>centrale</b> between them. The two bones of the proximal row
are the <b>astragalus</b> and <b>calcaneum</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>astragalus</b> (fig. 80, 10) corresponds to the fused
<b>tibiale</b> and <b>intermedium</b> of the typical tarsus. Its proximal
end is much wider than its distal end, and forms a large
rounded <b>condyle</b> articulating with the tibia, while its posterior
end meets the navicular. It lies to the dorsal side of
the foot.</p>

<p>The <b>calcaneum</b> (fibulare) (fig. 80, 11), the thickest bone
in the pes, lies somewhat behind, and to the outer side of the
astragalus. It articulates with the astragalus and fibula, and
is drawn out behind into a long rounded process, which forms
the heel, and is in the young animal terminated by an epiphysis.
Between the proximal and distal rows of tarsals is
the <b>navicular</b> (centrale) (fig. 80, 12), a somewhat flattened
and square bone articulating with the astragalus.</p>

<p>The distal row of tarsals consists of four bones. The
<b>internal cuneiform</b> (tarsale 1) is a smooth flattened bone
lying to the inner side of the foot; it articulates with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
first metatarsal and with the navicular. The <b>middle cuneiform</b>
(tarsale 2) (fig. 80, 13) is a still smaller bone, lying
external to the internal cuneiform. It articulates with the
second metatarsal and with the navicular. The <b>external
cuneiform</b> (tarsale 3) (fig. 80, 14) is a larger, somewhat square
bone lying external to the middle cuneiform. It articulates
with the third metatarsal and with the navicular. The <b>cuboid</b>
(tarsalia 4 and 5) (fig. 80, 15) is a considerably larger bone
lying to the outer side of the foot. It articulates with the
fourth and fifth metatarsals and with the calcaneum.</p>

<p>The pes has sometimes five digits, sometimes four, the
hallux being absent. Even when present the <b>hallux</b> (fig. 80,
<b>B, I</b>) is commonly much reduced, and may be quite vestigial,
and represented only by a small nodular metatarsal.</p>

<p>Each of the other digits consists of a long metatarsal,
which in the young animal has a prominent epiphysis at its
distal end, and of three phalanges. The proximal and middle
phalanges have epiphyses at their proximal ends, while the
distal phalanx is without epiphyses and is claw-shaped.</p>

<small>GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN MAMMALIA.</small></h2>


<p class="cen">THE EXOSKELETON AND VERTEBRAL COLUMN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Epidermal Exoskeleton</span>.</p>

<p><b>Hair</b>, which forms the characteristic Mammalian exoskeleton,
varies much in different animals, and in different
parts of the same animal. A large proportion of mammals
have the surface fairly uniformly covered with hair of one
kind only. In some forms however there are two kinds of
hair, a longer and stiffer kind alone appearing on the surface,
and a shorter and softer kind forming the under fur. In
most mammals hairs of a special character occur in certain
regions, such as above the eyes, on the margins of the
eyelids, and on the lips and cheeks, here forming the vibrissae
or whiskers.</p>

<p>Sometimes as in <i>Hippopotamus</i>, <i>Orycteropus</i> and the Sirenia,
the hair, though scattered over the whole surface, is extremely
scanty, while in the Cetacea it is limited to a few bristles
in the neighbourhood of the mouth, or may even be absent
altogether in the adult. In most mammals the hairs are
shed and renewed at intervals, sometimes twice a year, before
and after the winter. The vibrissae or large hairs which
occur in many animals upon the upper lip, and the mane and
tail of Equidae are probably persistent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>In the hedgehogs, porcupines and <i>Echidna</i> certain of the
hairs are modified and greatly enlarged, forming stiff spines.
Similar spines occur in the young of <i>Centetes</i>, and in <i>Acanthomys</i>
among the Muridae.</p>

<p>Several other forms of epidermal exoskeleton are met with
in mammals, including:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Scales</b>. These overlie the bony scutes of armadillos
and occur covering the tail in several groups of mammals, such
as beavers and rats. In the Manidae the body is covered by
flat scales which overlap.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <b>horns</b> of Bovine Ruminants. These, which must
on no account be confused with antlers, are hollow cases of
hardened epidermis fitting on to bony outgrowths of the frontals.
In almost every case they are unbranched structures growing
continuously throughout life, and are very rarely shed entire.
In the Prongbuck <i>Antilocapra</i> however they are bifurcated and
are periodically shed. Horns are nearly always limited to a
single pair, but the four-horned antelope <i>Tetraceros</i> has two
pairs, the anterior pair being the smaller.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The <b>horns of Rhinoceroses</b>. These are conical
structures composed of a solid mass of hardened epidermal
cells growing from a cluster of long dermal papillae. From
each papilla there grows a fibre which resembles a thick hair,
and cementing the whole together are cells which grow from
the interspaces between the papillae. These fibres differ from
true hairs in not being developed in pits in the dermis.
Rhinoceros horns may be either one or two in number, and
are borne on the fronto-nasal region of the skull. They vary
much in length, the longest recorded having the enormous
length of fifty-seven inches.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Nails</i>, <i>hoofs</i> and <b>claws</b>. In almost all mammals
except the Cetacea, these are found terminating the digits of
both limbs. <b>Nails</b> are more or less flattened structures,
<b>claws</b> are pointed and somewhat curved. In most mammals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the nails tend to surround the ends of the digits much more
than they do in man. Sometimes the nail of one digit differs
from that of all the others; thus the second digit of the pes in
the Hyracoidea and Lemuroidea is terminated by a long claw,
the other digits having flat nails. In the Felidae the claws
are retractile, the ungual phalanx with claw attached folding
back when the animal is at rest into a sheath, above, or by
the side of the middle phalanx. In the Sloths and Bats
enormously developed claws occur, forming hooks by which the
animals suspend themselves. In <i>Notoryctes</i> the third and
fourth digits of the manus bear claws of great size; similar
claws occur in <i>Chrysochloris</i>, being correlated in each case
with fossorial habits. The nail at its maximum development
entirely surrounds the terminal phalanx of the digit to which
it is attached, and is then called a <b>hoof</b>. Hoofs are specially
characteristic of the Ungulata.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <b>Spurs</b> and <b>beaks</b> are structures which are hardly represented
among mammals, while so characteristic of birds.
They are however both found in the Monotremata. In
both <i>Echidna</i> and <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> the male has a peculiar
hollow horny spur borne on a sesamoid bone articulated to
the tibia. The jaws in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> are cased in horny
beaks similar to those of birds, and are provided with horny
pads which act as teeth.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <b>Horny plates</b> of a ridged or roughened character
occur upon the anterior portion of the palate, and of the mandibular
symphysis in all three genera of recent Sirenia; also
upon the toothless anterior portion of the palate in Ruminants.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The <b>baleen of whales</b> also belongs to the epidermal
exoskeleton. It consists of a number of flattened horny plates
arranged in a double series along the palate. The plates are
somewhat triangular in form and have their bases attached
to the palate at right angles to its long axis, while their apices
hang downwards into the mouth cavity. The outer edge
of each plate is hard and smooth, while the inner edge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
apex fray out into long fibres which look like hair. At the
inner edge of each principal plate are subsidiary smaller plates.
The plates are formed of a number of fibres each developed
round a dermal papilla in the same way as are the fibres
forming the horns of <i>Rhinoceros</i>. Baleen and Rhinoceros
horn likewise agree in that the fibres are bound together by
less hardened epithelial cells, which readily wear away and
allow the harder fibres to fray out. The greatest development
of baleen occurs in the Northern Right whale, <i>Balaena
mysticetus</i>, in which the plates number three hundred and
eighty or more on each side, and reach a length of ten or
twelve feet near the middle of the series.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dermal Exoskeleton.</span></p>

<p>Mammals show two principal kinds of exoskeletal structures
which are entirely or partially dermal in origin, viz. the
bony scutes of armadillos, and teeth.</p>

<p>The <b>bony scutes of armadillos</b> are quadrate or polygonal
in shape and are in general aggregated together, forming
several shields protecting various regions of the body. The
head is generally protected by a <i>cephalic</i> shield, the anterior
part of the body by a <i>scapular</i>, and the posterior by a <i>pelvic</i>
shield. The tail is also generally encased in bony rings, and
scutes are irregularly scattered over the surface of the limbs.
The mid-body region is protected by a varying number of
bands of scutes united by soft skin, so as to allow of movement.
Corresponding to each dermal scute is an epidermal
plate. In <i>Chlamydophorus</i> the scutes are mainly confined to
the posterior region where they form a strong vertically-placed
shield which coalesces with the pelvis. The anterior part of
the body is mainly covered by horny epidermal plates with
very little ossification beneath. In the gigantic extinct
Glyptodonts the body is covered with a solid carapace
formed by the union of an immense number of plates, and
there are no movable rings. The top of the head is defended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
by a similar plate, the tail is generally encased in an unjointed
bony tube, and there is commonly a ventral plastron.</p>

<p>In <i>Phocaena phocaenoides</i> the occurrence of vestigial dermal
ossicles has been described, and in <i>Zeuglodon</i> the back was
probably protected by dermal plates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth</span><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p>Teeth are well developed in the vast majority of mammalia,
and are of the greatest morphological and systematic importance,
many extinct forms being known only by their teeth.
Mammalian teeth differ from those of lower animals in various
well-marked respects. (1) They are attached only to the
maxillae, premaxillae and mandible, never to the palatines,
pterygoids or other bones. (2) They frequently have more
than one root. (3) They are always, except in some Odontoceti,
placed in distinct sockets. (4) They are hardly ever
ankylosed to the bone. (5) They are in most cases markedly
heterodont. (6) They are commonly developed in two sets,
the milk dentition and permanent dentition.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that teeth after being formed are
reabsorbed without ever cutting the gum. This is the case,
for instance, with the upper incisors of Ruminants.</p>

<p>The form of mammalian teeth varies much, some are simple
conical structures comparable to those of most reptiles, and
these may either have persistent pulps, as in the case of the
upper canines of the Walrus and the tusks of Elephants, or
may be rooted as in most canine teeth. Some teeth have chisel-shaped
edges, and this may be their original form, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
human incisors, or may, as in those of Rodents, be brought
about by the more rapid wearing away of the posterior edge,
the anterior edge being hardened by a layer of enamel.
Then, again, the crown may, as in the majority of grinding
teeth, be more or less flattened. The various terms used in
describing some of the forms of the surface of grinding teeth
are defined on page 345.</p>

<p>The teeth of the Aard Varks are compound, and differ
completely from those of all other mammals (see p. 425).</p>

<p>As a rule, the higher the general organisation of an animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the better are its milk teeth developed, and the more do they
form a reproduction on a small scale of the permanent set.
This fact is well seen in the Primates, Carnivora and Ungulata.
The method of notation by which the dentition of any
mammal can be briefly expressed as a formula has been already
described. The regular mammalian arrangement of teeth for
each side is expressed by the formula</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> × 2; total, 44.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monotremata.</span> In <i>Echidna</i> teeth are quite absent. In
the young <i>Ornithorhynchus</i><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> functional molar teeth of a multi-tubercular
type resembling those of some Mesozoic mammalia
are present, but in the adult they disappear, their office being
discharged by horny plates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> have a heterodont dentition, which has
generally been regarded as almost monophyodont, the only
tooth which has an obvious deciduous predecessor being the
last premolar. The researches of Röse<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and Kükenthal<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> tend
to show that the teeth of Marsupials are developed in the
same way as in other mammals, and are diphyodont. In
the case of the premolars, teeth which are homologous with
the permanent teeth of other mammals begin to develop as
lateral outgrowths from the milk teeth, but afterwards become
absorbed, so that the teeth which actually persist belong
to the milk series. The last premolar, however, does as
a rule develop and replace its milk predecessor; sometimes,
however, as in <i>Didelphys</i>, it takes its place among the milk
molars without replacing one of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>The types of dentition characteristic of the different groups
of placental mammals may mostly be paralleled among
the Marsupials. Thus among the polyprotodont forms the
Didelphyidae or opossums, and some of the Dasyuridae, such
as <i>Sarcophilus</i> and <i>Thylacinus</i>, have a typical carnivorous
dentition with small incisors, large canines, and molars with
pointed compressed crowns. The dental formula of <i>Thylacinus</i>,
is <i>i</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, total 46.</p>

<p>In <i>Myrmecobius</i> five or six molar teeth occur on each side,
and the total number of teeth reaches fifty-two or fifty-six.
The teeth bear rows of tubercles, and resemble those of the
Multituberculate mesozoic Mammals<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, more than do those of
any other living form. Calcified teeth have recently been
described<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> in <i>Myrmecobius</i> earlier than the functional or milk
set. This would relegate the milk teeth of mammals in general
to a second series, and the permanent teeth to a third. In
<i>Notoryctes</i> the dental formula<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> is given as <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub>,
total 40. The canines are small, and the anterior molars
have strongly developed cusps, and much resemble those of
<i>Chrysochloris</i> (Insectivora).</p>

<p>Among the diprotodont types the Phascolomyidae, or
Wombats, have a dentition recalling that of the Rodents. All
the teeth grow from persistent pulps, and the incisors have
enamel only on the anterior surface as in Rodents. The dental
formula is <i>i</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, total 24. There are indications
of a vestigial second pair of incisors.</p>

<p>The Macropodidae, or Kangaroos, have a herbivorous
dentition with the formula <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>(0&mdash;1)</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub>. The incisors
are sharp and cutting, and are separated by a long diastema or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
gap from the molars, which have their crowns marked by ridges
or cusps. There are indications of several vestigial incisors.</p>

<p><i>Coenolestes</i>, a remarkable form recently described from
America, belongs to the diprotodont section, and is the only
living member of the section known outside the Australian
region<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. An exceptional dentition is seen in the case of the
extinct <i>Thylacoleo</i>, in which the functional teeth are reduced
to two pairs; one pair of large cutting incisors and one of
compressed sharp-edged premolars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edentata.</span> Some Edentata, viz. the ant-eaters (Myrmecophagidae)
are, as far as is known, absolutely toothless at all
stages of their existence; being the only mammals except
<i>Echidna</i> in which no tooth germs have been discovered;
others, viz. the Manidae, though showing foetal tooth germs,
are quite toothless in post-foetal life; others, viz. some of
the armadillos, have the largest number of teeth met with in
land mammals. The teeth are homodont except in the Aard
Varks, and grow from persistent pulps. In the sloths (Bradypodidae)
and the Megatheriidae, there are five pairs of teeth in
the upper and four in the lower jaw. The teeth of sloths consist
of a central axis of vasodentine, surrounded firstly by a thin coating
of hard dentine, and secondly by a thick coating of cement.</p>

<p>In no living Edentate have the teeth any enamel; it has,
however, been described as occurring in certain early Megatheroid
forms from S. America<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, and an enamel organ has
also been discovered in an embryo <i>Dasypus</i><a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. In the Armadillos
(Dasypodidae) the number of teeth varies from <sup>8</sup>/<sub>8</sub> or <sup>7</sup>/<sub>7</sub> in
<i>Tatusia</i>, to upwards of <sup>25</sup>/<sub>25</sub> in <i>Priodon</i>, which therefore may have
upwards of a hundred teeth, the largest number met with in any
land mammal. In <i>Tatusia</i> all the teeth except the last are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
preceded by two-rooted milk teeth. The Aard Varks are
diphyodont, and milk teeth are also known in a species of
<i>Dasypus</i>, but with these exceptions Edentates are, as far as is
known, monophyodont. In <i>Glyptodon</i> the teeth are almost
divided into three lobes by two deep grooves on each side.</p>

<p>The Aard Varks (Orycteropodidae) are quite exceptional
as regards their teeth, which are cylindrical in shape, and
are made up of a number of elongated denticles fused together.
Each denticle contains a pulp cavity from which a
number of minute tubes radiate outwards. These teeth are
diphyodont and somewhat heterodont, eight to ten pairs occur
in the upper jaw and eight in the lower, but they are not all in
place at one time. The last three teeth in each jaw are not
preceded by milk teeth<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sirenia.</span> The teeth of Sirenia show several very distinct
types, the least modified being that of the extinct Halitheriidae,
which have large incisors in the upper jaw, and five
or six pairs of tuberculated grinding teeth in each jaw, the
anterior ones being preceded by milk teeth.</p>

<p>In both the living genera the dentition is monophyodont.
In <i>Manatus</i> the dentition is <i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>pm</i> and <i>m</i> <sup>11</sup>/<sub>11</sub>. The incisors are
vestigial, and disappear before maturity. The grinding teeth
have square enamelled crowns marked by transverse tuberculated
ridges. They are not all present in the jaw at the same
time. In <i>Halicore</i> the upper jaw bears a pair of straight tusklike
incisors; in the male these have persistent pulps and
project out of the mouth; in the female they soon cease to
grow and are never cut. They are separated by a long
diastema from the grinding teeth which have tuberculated
crowns and are <sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub> or <sup>6</sup>/<sub>6</sub> in number, but are not all in place at
once. Several other pairs of slender teeth occur in the young
animal, but are absorbed or fall out before maturity. In
<i>Rhytina</i> teeth are altogether absent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cetacea.</span></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Archaeoceti.</span></i> <i>Zeuglodon</i> has the following dentition,
<i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> and <i>m</i> <sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, total 36. The incisors and canines are
simple and conical; the cheek teeth are compressed and have
serrated cutting edges like those in some seals.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Mystacoceti</span></i>, or whalebone whales, calcified tooth
germs probably belonging to the milk dentition are present
in the embryo, but they are never functional, and are altogether
absent in the adult. The anterior of these germs
are simple, the posterior ones are originally complex, but
subsequently split up into simple teeth like those of the
anterior part of the jaw. Hence according to Kükenthal,
who described these structures, the Cetacean dentition was
originally heterodont.</p>

<p>In the living <i><span class="smcap">Odontoceti</span></i> the dentition is homodont and
monophyodont. In some cases traces occur of a replacing
dentition which never comes to maturity, and renders it probable
that the functional teeth of the Odontoceti are really
homologous with the milk teeth of other mammals. Some of
the dolphins afford the apparently simplest type of mammalian
dentition known. The teeth are all simple, conical, slightly
recurved structures, with simple tapering roots and without
enamel. The dentition is typically <i>piscivorous</i>, being adapted
for seizing active slippery animals such as fish. The prey is
then swallowed entire without mastication. Sometimes the
teeth are excessively numerous, reaching two hundred or more
(fifty to sixty on each side of each jaw) in <i>Pontoporia</i>. This
multiplication of teeth is regarded by Kükenthal as due to the
division into three parts of numbers of trilobed teeth similar to
those of some seals.</p>

<p>In the Sperm whale, <i>Physeter</i>, the lower jaw bears a series
of twenty to twenty-five stout conical recurved teeth, while in
the upper jaw the teeth are vestigial and remain imbedded in
the gum. An extinct form, <i>Physodon</i>, from the Pliocene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Europe and Patagonia is allied to the Sperm whale, but has
teeth in both jaws. In the <ins class="edcorr" title="p. 427, line 2, for Grampus read Killer.">Killer</ins> <i>Orca</i>, the teeth number
about <sup>12</sup>/<sub>12</sub>, and are very large and strong. In some forms the
teeth are very much reduced in number; thus in <i>Mesoplodon</i>
the dentition consists simply of a pair of conical teeth borne
in the mandible. In the Narwhal <i>Monodon</i> the dentition is
practically reduced to a single pair of teeth, which lie horizontally
in the maxillae, and in the female normally remain permanently
in the alveoli. In the male the right tooth remains
rudimentary, while the left is developed into an enormous
cylindrical tusk marked by a spiral groove. Occasionally both
teeth develop into tusks, and there is reason for thinking that
two-tusked individuals are generally or always female. In the
extinct <i>Squalodon</i> the dentition is decidedly heterodont, and
the molars have two roots. The dental formula is</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>7</sup>/<sub>7</sub>, total 60.</p>

<p>It is probable that the homodont condition of modern Odontoceti
is not primitive, but due to retrogressive evolution.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata</span>.</p>

<p>Just as in the Cetacea a piscivorous dentition is most
typically developed, so the Ungulata are, as a group, the most
characteristic representatives of a <i>herbivorous</i> dentition in its
various forms.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Artiodactyla</i></span>. As regards the living forms, the Artiodactyla
can be readily divided into two groups, namely those
with bunodont and those with selenodont teeth. It has, however,
been shown that selenodont teeth always pass through
an embryonic bunodont stage<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. The bunodont type is best seen
in Pigs and Hippopotami and such extinct forms as <i>Hyotherium</i>.
In <i>Hippopotamus</i> the dental formula is <i>i</i> <sup>(2-3)</sup>/<sub>(1-3)</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>The incisors and canines of <i>Hippopotamus</i> are very large
and grow continuously. The genus <i>Sus</i>, which affords a good
instance of an <i>omnivorous</i> type of dentition, has the regular
unmodified Mammalian dental formula <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total
44. The canines, specially in the male, are large and have
persistent pulps, and the upper canines do not have the usual
downward direction but pass outwards and upwards. In the
Wart Hog, <i>Phacochaerus</i>, they are enormously large, but a
still more extraordinary development of teeth is found in
<i>Babirussa</i>. In the male <i>Babirussa</i> the canines, which are without
enamel, are long, curved and grow continuously. Those of
the upper jaw never enter the mouth, but pierce the skin of
the face and curve backwards over the forehead. The dental
formula of <i>Babirussa</i> is <i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 34.</p>

<p>The Wart Hog has a very anomalous dentition, for as
age advances all the teeth except the canines and last molars
show signs of disappearing; both pairs of persisting teeth are
however very large.</p>

<p>Various extinct Ungulata such as <i>Anoplotherium</i> have
teeth which are intermediate in character between the bunodont
and selenodont types. <i>Anoplotherium</i> has the regular
mammalian series of forty-four teeth. The crowns of all the
teeth are equal in height, and there is no diastema&mdash;an
arrangement found in no living mammal but man.</p>

<p>We come now to the selenodont Artiodactyla.</p>

<p>The Tylopoda&mdash;camels (Camelidae) and Llamas (Aucheniidae)
when young have the full number of incisors, but in the adult
the two upper middle ones are lost. The molars are typically
selenodont and hypsodont<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. In the Camel the dental formula
is <i>i</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 34. The upper incisors, canines and
first premolars of the Camel are very small teeth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
first premolar is separated by a long diastema from the
others.</p>

<p>The Tragulina or Chevrotains have no upper incisors, while
the canines are largely developed, especially in the male.</p>

<p>The Ruminantia or Pecora are very uniform as regards
their dentition. The upper incisors are always absent, for
though their germs are developed they are reabsorbed without
ever becoming visible, and as a rule the upper canines are
absent too, while the lower canines are incisiform. The
grinding teeth are typically selenodont, and in the lower jaw
form a continuous series separated by a wide diastema from
the canines. The dental formula is usually</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> 0-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The canines are largely developed in the male Muskdeer
(<i>Moschus</i>) and in <i>Hydropotes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Perissodactyla</i></span>. The premolars and molars have a very
similar structure and form a continuous series of large
square teeth with complex crowns. The crowns are always
constructed on some modification of the bilophodont<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> plan, as
is easily seen in the case of the forms with brachydont teeth,
but in animals like the Horse, in which the teeth are very
hypsodont, this arrangement is hard to trace. All four premolars
in the upper jaw are preceded by milk teeth, while in
Artiodactyla the first has no milk predecessors.</p>

<p>In the Tapiridae the grinding teeth are brachydont and
the lower ones are typically bilophodont. The last two upper
molars have the transverse ridges united by an outer longitudinal
ridge. The dentition is <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 42.</p>

<p>In some of the extinct Perissodactyles such as <i>Lophiodon</i><a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the dentition is brachydont and bilophodont, the grinding
teeth in general <ins class="mycorr" title='Correction: text was "resembing"'>resembling</ins> the posterior upper molars of the
Tapir. The same type of brachydont tooth is seen in <i>Palaeotherium</i>
but the transverse ridges are crescentic instead of
straight, and are separated from one another by shallow
valleys without cement. Some of the Palaeotheridae have the
regular series of forty-four teeth.</p>

<p>A complete series of forms is known showing how from the
simple brachydont teeth of the Palaeotheridae, were derived
the complicated hypsodont teeth of the Equidae. The increase
in depth of the tooth was accompanied by increase in the
depth and complexity of the enamel infoldings, and of the
cement filling them.</p>

<p>Both upper and lower grinding teeth of the Equidae are
much complicated by enamel infoldings, but their derivation
from the bilophodont type can still be recognised. The
diastema in front of the premolars is longer in the living
Equidae than in their extinct allies. In the adult horse the
dental formula is <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 40, with often a
vestigial first upper premolar (fig. 82, <i>pm</i> 1). The last molar is
not more complex than the others, and in the female the canine
is quite vestigial. The incisors are large and adapted for cutting
and have the enamel curiously folded in forming a deep pit.
The milk dentition is <i>di</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>dc</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>dpm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 24. The last
milk premolar is not more complex than the premolar that
succeeds it. The horse affords an excellent instance of a
typically <i>herbivorous</i> type of dentition, the cutting incisors,
reduced canines and series of large square flat-crowned grinding
teeth being most characteristic.</p>

<p>In <i>Rhinoceros</i> the grinding teeth are much like those of
<i>Lophiodon</i>, having an outer longitudinal ridge from which two
crescentic transverse ridges diverge. The upper premolars are
as complex as the molars, and there are no canines; in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
species incisors also are absent. The dental formula is</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>(0&mdash;2)</sup>/<sub>(0&mdash;1)</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>(0&mdash;1)</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Among the Titanotheriidae <i>Palaeosyops</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> has very brachydont
teeth whose crowns have been described as <i>buno-selenodont</i>,
the inner pair of columns being bunodont, the outer, selenodont.
Similar grinding teeth occur in <i>Chalicotherium</i>. Some
of the Titanotheriidae have the regular mammalian series of
forty-four teeth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Subungulata.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Toxodontia.</i></span> <i>Nesodon</i> has the regular dental formula;
its grinding teeth are rooted and the upper ones resemble those
of Rhinoceros. The second upper and third lower incisors
form ever-growing tusks. There is a marked difference between
the deciduous and permanent dentition. <i>Astrapotherium</i> likewise
has large rooted cheek teeth of a rhinocerotic type, and
each jaw bears a pair of permanently growing tusks, those
of the lower jaw being the canines. The dental formula is</p>

<p>
<i>i</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 28.
</p>

<p>In <i>Toxodon</i> the upper incisors and molars are large and curved
and all the teeth have persistent pulps. In <i>Typotherium</i> there
are no tusks, but the upper incisors are chisel-like, recalling
those of Rodents.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap"><i>Condylarthra</i></span> have brachydont, generally bunodont
teeth, with the premolars simpler than the molars. They
generally have the regular dental formula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Hyracoidea.</i></span> The dental formula of <i>Procavia</i> is usually

fall out. The upper incisors resemble those of Rodents in
being long and curved and growing from persistent pulps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
They are however triangular in transverse section, not rectangular,
having two antero-lateral faces covered with enamel
and a posterior face without enamel. Their terminations
are pointed, not chisel-shaped as in Rodents. The lower incisors
(fig. 83, <i>i</i> 1) are pectinate or partially divided by vertical
fissures, and the grinding teeth are of the rhinocerotic type.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Amblypoda.</i></span> Two of the best known forms belonging to
this extinct group differ much as regards dentition. For while
<i>Coryphodon</i> has the regular dental formula, and the canines
of both jaws of moderate size, in <i>Uintatherium</i> the dentition
is very specialised, there are no upper incisors, and the upper
canines form a pair of enormous tusks. The grinding teeth
form a continuous series marked by <b>V</b>-shaped ridges and the
dental formula is <i>i</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> total 34.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Proboscidea.</i></span> The incisors are composed entirely of dentine
and have the form of conical tusks projecting greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
from the mouth. In living forms they are confined to the
upper jaw, in some species of the extinct <i>Mastodon</i> however
they occur in the lower jaw also. In <i>Dinotherium</i> they are
probably absent from the upper jaw, but form a pair of
downwardly and backwardly-directed tusks growing from the
elongated symphysis of the mandible.</p>

<p>The grinding teeth in the various Proboscidea show a very
remarkable series of modifications. In <i>Dinotherium</i> they are
bilophodont or else are marked by three straight transverse
ridges. The dental formula is <i>i</i> <sup>0?</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, and the
teeth have the normal method of succession. In <i>Mastodon</i>
as in <i>Dinotherium</i> the grinding teeth are marked by
transverse ridges, but the ridges are subdivided into conical or
mammillary cusps, and similar cusps often occur between
the ridges. These cusps are covered with very thick enamel
and the spaces between them are not filled up with cement.
There are six of these grinding teeth for each side of each
jaw but only three are in place at once. The first three are
milk teeth as they may be succeeded vertically by others.</p>

<p>In the true Elephants the number and depth of the enamel
folds is much increased, and the spaces between the folds are
filled up with cement. A very complete series of extinct
forms is known with teeth intermediate in character between
those of <i>Mastodon</i> and those of the Mammoth and living
elephants. The dental formula of <i>Elephas</i> is</p>

in Elephants as follows: "As regards the mode of succession

During the complete lifetime of the animal there are but six
molar teeth on each side of each jaw with occasionally a rudimentary
one in front, completing the typical number of seven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
The last three represent the true molars of ordinary mammals,
those in front appear to be milk molars which are never replaced
by permanent successors, but the whole series gradually
moves forwards in the jaw, and the teeth become worn away
and their remnants cast out in front while development of
others proceeds behind. The individual teeth are so large
and the processes of growth and destruction by wear take
place so slowly, that not more than one or portions of two
teeth are ever in place and in use on each side of each jaw
at one time, and the whole series of changes coincides with
the usual duration of the animal's life. On the other hand
the <i>Dinotherium</i>, the opposite extreme of the Proboscidean
series, has the whole of the molar teeth in place and use at
one time, and the milk molars are vertically displaced by premolars
in the ordinary fashion. Among Mastodons transitional
forms occur in the mode of succession as well as in
structure, many species showing a vertical displacement of
one or more of the milk molars, and the same has been observed
in one extinct species of Elephant (<i>E. planifrons</i>) as
regards the posterior of these teeth."</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Tillodontia</span> the grinding teeth are of Ungulate
type, while the second incisors are large and grow from persistent
pulps, so as to resemble those of Rodents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> have a most characteristic and very constant
dentition, the common dental formula being</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>(0&mdash;1)</sup>/<sub>(0&mdash;1)</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 18 or 20.</p>

<p>The incisors always have chisel-like edges and persistent
pulps, and are separated by a wide diastema from the
premolars. Canines are always absent, and there are generally
three grinding teeth not preceded by milk teeth;
their surface may be grooved, or may be bunodont. Teeth
are most numerous in the Duplicidentata (Hares and Rabbits),
in which the formula is <i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 28, and fewest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>

only rodents which have well developed deciduous incisors,
though a vestigial milk incisor has been described in the
Mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>). The last upper molar of <i>Hydrochaerus</i>
is very complicated, its structure approaching that of the teeth
of Elephants.</p>

<p>In <i><span class="smcap">Carnivora vera</span></i> the incisors are almost always <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. The
fourth upper premolar and first lower molar are differentiated
as carnassial teeth (see p. 436), and retain fundamentally the
same characters throughout the suborder. The upper carnassial
(fig. 84, I. II. III.) consists of a more or less compressed,
commonly trilobed blade borne on two roots, with an inner
tubercle borne on a third root. The lower carnassial has only
two roots; its crown consists of a bilobed blade with generally
an inner cusp, and a heel or talon (fig. 84, 4) behind the blade.</p>

<p>The most thoroughly carnivorous type of dentition is seen
in the &AElig;luroidea, and especially in the cat tribe (Felidae). In
the genus <i>Felis</i> the dental formula is <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub>, total 30.
The incisors are very small, so as not to interfere with the
action of the large canines, the lower carnassial is reduced to
simply the bilobed blade (fig. 84, IV), and the cheek teeth are
greatly subordinated to the carnassial. The extinct <i>Machaerodus</i>
has the upper canines comparable in size to those of the
Walrus.</p>

<p>The Civets and Hyaenas have a dentition allying them
closely to the cats. The hyaena-like <i>Proteles</i> has, however,
the grinding teeth greatly reduced.</p>

<p>In the Cynoidea<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> the general dentition is <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>,
total 42. This differs from the regular mammalian dentition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
only in the absence of the last upper molar. The upper
carnassial tooth (fig. 84, II.) consists of a larger middle and
smaller posterior lobe with hardly any trace of an anterior
lobe. The lower carnassial (fig. 84, V.) is typical, consisting
of a bilobed blade with inner cusp and posterior talon.</p>

<p>The dentition of the Cynoidea is most closely linked with
that of the Arctoidea by means of fossil forms.</p>

<p>In the Arctoidea the dentition is not so typically carnivorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
as in the &AElig;luroidea and Cynoidea. In the bears, Ursidae,
the molars have broad flat tuberculated crowns (fig. 85). The
dental formula in <i>Ursus</i> is <i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 42. The
upper carnassial (fig. 84, III.) differs from that of the &AElig;luroidea
and Cynoidea in having no inner lobe supported on a
third root. In the large group of Mustelidae there are generally
two molars in the lower and one in the upper jaw. The
grinding teeth commonly have large, flattened, more or less
tuberculated crowns, and the upper molar may be as large or
much smaller than the carnassial.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Creodonta</span></i> there are no specially differentiated

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Pinnipedia</span></i> the dentition differs considerably from
that of the Carnivora vera. The milk dentition is always
vestigial, and the teeth are frequently absorbed before birth.
There are four premolars and one molar, forming an uniform
series of cheek teeth, all of which except in the Walrus have
compressed and pointed, never flattened, crowns. There is
no special carnassial tooth, and the incisors are always fewer
than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. In <i>Otaria</i> the dentition is</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>m</i> 1 or <sup>2</sup>/<sub>1</sub>, total 34 or 36.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Walrus the upper canines form immense tusks. The
other teeth are all small and one-rooted, and the molars have
flat crowns. In the true seals the dentition is strikingly piscivorous,
the cheek teeth often having accessory cusps (fig. 86).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> are diphyodont and heterodont, having
well-developed rooted teeth. The canines are usually weak,
the incisors pointed, and those of the two jaws often meet
like a pair of forceps. The crowns of the molars are characteristically
studded with short cusps. Some genera, such as
<i>Gymnura</i> and the mole, <i>Talpa</i>, have the regular mammalian
dentition. In the hedgehog, <i>Erinaceus</i>, the dentition is</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 36.</p>

<p>In the genus <i>Sorex</i> (Shrews) the teeth differ in the following
two marked respects from those of most other Monodelphia,
(1) they are monophyodont, (2) the lower incisors sometimes
become fused to the jaws. Most Insectivora have square molar
teeth, but in <i>Potamogale</i>, <i>Chrysochloris</i>, <i>Solenodon</i> and the
Centetidae the molar teeth are triangular in section. Four
molars occur in <i>Centetes</i>.</p>

<p>In the aberrant genus <i>Galeopithecus</i> the dentition is
<i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 34. The upper incisors are placed at
some distance from the anterior end of the jaw, and the outer
upper incisors and canines of both jaws have two roots,&mdash;a
very unusual character. The lower incisors are deeply grooved
or pectinated in the same way as are the lower incisors of <i>Procavia</i>.
The upper incisors and canines of both jaws bear many
cusps, and are very similar in appearance to the cheek teeth of
some Seals.</p>

<p>The dentition of the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> is diphyodont and heterodont,
and the dental formula never exceeds</p>

<p class="cen"><i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> pm <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 38.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>The milk teeth are very slender and have sharp recurved cusps;
they are quite unlike the permanent teeth. The permanent
teeth are of two types. In the Insectivorous forms the molar
teeth are cusped, and resemble those of Insectivora. In the
blood-sucking Vampire bat <i>Desmodus</i>, the teeth are peculiarly
modified; the canines and the single pair of upper incisors are
much enlarged and exceedingly sharp, while all the other
teeth are much reduced in size.</p>

<p>In the Frugivorous bats the molar teeth have nearly always
smooth crowns. The dental formula in the chief genus <i>Pteropus</i>
is <i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 34.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Primates</span> have a diphyodont and heterodont dentition,
generally of an omnivorous type, with cheek teeth adapted for
grinding. The incisors are generally <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and the molars, except
in the Hapalidae, are <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. In the Lemurs the upper canines
are large, and the lower incisors slender and directed almost
horizontally forwards. The Aye Aye, <i>Chiromys</i>, has the following
singular dentition: <i>i</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>0</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 18. The incisors
much resemble those of rodents having persistent pulps,
and enamel only on the anterior face.</p>

<p>In Man and in the Anthropoid and Old World Apes
the dental formula is always <i>i</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>c</i> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> <i>pm</i> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, total 32.</p>

<p>In the Cebidae there is an extra premolar in each jaw
bringing the number up to 36. In the Hapalidae, as in the
Cebidae, there is a third premolar, but the molars are reduced
to <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. Man is the only Primate that has the teeth arranged
in a continuous series. In all the others there is a gap or
diastema of larger or smaller size between the incisors and
canines. In all except man also the canines are enlarged,
especially in the males.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vertebral Column.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cervical Vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae of all mammals have certain characters
in common. However long the neck may be, the
number of cervical vertebrae, with very few exceptions, is
seven. Movable ribs are generally absent, and if present
are small and do not reach the sternum. The transverse
processes are generally wide but not long, and are perforated
near the base by the vertebrarterial canals, through which
the vertebral arteries pass; they generally bear downwardly-directed
inferior lamellae which are sometimes as in the seventh
human cervical seen to ossify from centres distinct from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
forming the rest of the transverse process, and are really of
the nature of ribs. The atlas and axis always differ much
from the other vertebrae.</p>

<p>We may pass now to the special characters of the cervical
vertebrae in the different groups. In <span class="smcap">Monotremes</span> and <span class="smcap">Marsupials</span>
the number of cervical vertebrae is always seven. With
the exception of the atlas of <i>Echidna</i> the cervical vertebrae
of Monotremes are without zygapophyses. In Monotremes the
transverse processes ossify from centres distinct from that forming
the body, and remain suturally connected with the rest of
the vertebra until the adult condition is reached. The method
of the ossification of the atlas in Marsupials varies considerably,
thus in some forms such as the Wombats (<i>Phascolomys</i>) there is
an unossified gap in the middle of the inferior arch of the atlas,
which may remain permanently open; in <i>Thylacinus</i> this gap
is filled up by a distinct heart-shaped piece of bone, while in
<i>Didelphys</i> and <i>Perameles</i> the atlas is ossified below in the same
way as in other mammals. In <i>Notoryctes</i> the second to sixth
cervical vertebrae are ankylosed together.</p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae of the <span class="smcap">Edentata</span> have some remarkable
peculiarities. In the three-fingered Sloth, <i>Bradypus</i>,
there are nine cervical vertebrae, all except the last of which
have their transverse processes perforated by the vertebrarterial
canals. In a two-fingered sloth, <i>Choloepus hoffmanni</i>,
there are only six cervical vertebrae. In the Megatheriidae,
Anteaters (Myrmecophagidae), Pangolins (Manidae), and Aard
Varks (Orycteropodidae), the cervical vertebrae are normal,
but in the Armadillos (Dasypodidae), and still more in the
Glyptodonts, several of them are commonly fused together.
The fusion affects not only the centra, but also the neural
arches, so that the neural canals form a continuous tube.</p>

<p>In the Glyptodonts there is a complex joint at the base of
the neck to allow the partial retraction of the head within the
carapace. This arrangement recalls that in Tortoises.</p>

<p>As a rule the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> possess seven short cervical vertebrae,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
not fused together and not presenting any marked peculiarities.
In <i>Manatus</i> however there are only six cervical vertebrae and
they are very variable.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> there are invariably seven cervical vertebrae,
but they are always very short and are frequently even
before birth fused together by their centra into one continuous
mass (see fig. 67). Sometimes the last one or two are free. In
the Rorquals (<i>Balaenoptera</i>) however, the cervical vertebrae are
quite separate and distinct (fig. 87), and in the fluviatile Odontoceti,
<i>Platanista</i>, <i>Inia</i>, and <i>Pontoporia</i>, and also in <i>Beluga</i>
and <i>Monodon</i>, though very short they are free. In <i>Physeter</i>
the first vertebra is free while the others are fused. An
odontoid process is not commonly present even in Cetaceans
with free cervical vertebrae, but a very short one occurs in
the Rorquals. The cervical vertebrae of Rorquals give off
on each side two transverse processes (fig. 87, 3 and 4) which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
enclose between them a wide space. These processes are not
completely ossified till the animal is adult.</p>

<p>In all <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> the number of cervical vertebrae is seven.
Among the Artiodactyla two forms of the odontoid process of
the axis occurs; in the Suina and Tragulina it is conical, in
the Ruminantia and Tylopoda it is spout-like (fig. 88, 4). The
atlas in the Suina and to a less extent in the Ruminantia has
long flattened transverse processes, and the remaining cervical
vertebrae are opisthocoelous. Those of the Giraffe and Llama
(fig. 103) are noticeable for their great length. In the Tylopoda
the posterior half of the vertebrarterial canal is confluent
with the neural canal.</p>

<p>The Perissodactyla have remarkably opisthocoelous cervical
vertebrae. Those of <i>Macrauchenia</i> have the posterior half of
the vertebrarterial canal confluent with the neural canal as in
Tylopoda. In the Proboscidea they are short flattened discs
slightly opisthocoelous; the axis and seventh vertebra and to
a less extent the sixth have high neural spines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the atlas generally has broad wing-like
transverse processes, and the axis a large and long neural spine,
while the odontoid process is much developed. In the Jerboas
(<i>Dipus</i>) all the cervical vertebrae except the atlas are fused
together, a condition recalling that in armadillos.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> the wings of the atlas are well developed
(fig. 69, A, 1), and it is deeply cupped for articulation with
the condyles of the skull. The axis has a long odontoid process
and a high compressed neural spine (fig. 69, B, 4). The third
to sixth cervical vertebrae have large transverse processes with
prominent perforated inferior lamellae, whose ventral margins
in the third and fourth vertebrae diverge as they pass backwards,
while in the fifth they are parallel and in the sixth
convergent. The transverse processes of the seventh vertebra
have no inferior lamellae and are not perforated. Metapophyses
are often developed.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the cervical vertebrae vary considerably.
The neural spines except in the case of the axis are generally
very small and in the Shrews and Moles the neural arches
are exceedingly slender.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> all the cervical vertebrae are broad and
short with slender neural arches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primates.</span> In Man the cervical vertebrae have short blunt
transverse processes and small often bifid neural spines. The
neural and vertebrarterial canals are large. The atlas forms
a ring surrounding a large cavity, and has a very slender
inferior arch and small transverse processes. Traces of a pro-atlas
have been described in <i>Macacus</i> and <i>Cynocephalus</i>. The
axis has a prominent spine and odontoid process and short
transverse processes. In most Primates the cervical vertebrae
are very similar to those of man, but the inferior lamellae of
the transverse processes are better developed. In the Anthropoid
Apes the neural spines are as a rule much elongated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thoraco-lumbar, or Trunk vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span> there are nineteen thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae, sixteen (<i>Echidna</i>) or seventeen (<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>)
of which bear ribs. The transverse processes are very short
and do not articulate with the ribs, which are united to the
centra only.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span> there are always nineteen thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae, thirteen of which generally bear ribs. The
lumbar vertebrae frequently have large metapophyses and
anapophyses, these being specially well seen in the Kangaroos
and Koala (<i>Phascolarctus</i>).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Edentata</span> are very variable as regards their trunk
vertebrae. The two genera of Sloths differ much as regards
the number, for while <i>Bradypus</i> has only nineteen, fifteen or
sixteen of which bear ribs, <i>Choloepus</i> has twenty-seven, twenty-four
of which are thoracic, and bear ribs. In <i>Bradypus</i> a
small outgrowth from the transverse process articulates with
the neural arch of the succeeding vertebra. In both genera
the neural spines are all directed backwards.</p>

<p>In the Megatheriidae as in the sloths the neural spines
are all directed backwards, and in the lumbar region additional
articulating surfaces occur, better developed than are those in
<i>Bradypus</i>.</p>

<p>In the ant-eaters (Myrmecophagidae) there are seventeen
or eighteen thoraco-lumbar vertebrae, all of which except two
or three bear ribs. The posterior thoracic and anterior lumbar
vertebrae articulate in a very complex fashion, second, third, and
fourth pairs of zygapophyses being progressively developed in
addition to the ordinary ones, as the vertebrae are followed back.</p>

<p>In the Armadillos the lumbar vertebrae have long metapophyses
which project upwards and forwards and help to
support the carapace. In <i>Glyptodon</i> almost all the thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae are completely ankylosed together.</p>

<p>In the Manidae there are no additional zygapophyses but
the normal ones of the lumbar and posterior thoracic regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
are very much developed, the postzygapophyses being semi-cylindrical
and fitting into the deep prezygapophyses of the
succeeding vertebra.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the number of lumbar vertebrae is very
small; in the dugong there are nineteen thoracic and four
lumbar, and in the manatee seventeen thoracic and two lumbar.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> the number of thoracic vertebrae varies from
nine in <i>Hyperoödon</i> to fifteen or sixteen in <i>Balaenoptera</i>, and
the number of lumbar vertebrae from three in <i>Inia</i> to twenty-four
or more in <i>Delphinus</i>. The lumbar vertebrae are often
very loosely articulated together and the zygapophyses sometimes
as in the Dolphins are placed high up on the neural
spines. The centra are large, short in the anterior region but
becoming longer behind. The epiphyses are prominent, and
so are the neural spines and to a less extent the metapophyses.
The transverse processes are well developed, anteriorly they
arise high up on the neural arch, but when the vertebral
column is followed back they come gradually to be placed lower
down, till in the lumbar region they project from the middle of
the centra. This can be well traced in the Porpoise (<i>Phocaena</i>).
In the Physeteridae the transverse processes of the anterior
thoracic vertebrae are similar to those of most Cetacea, but
when followed back, instead of shifting their position on the
vertebrae, they gradually disappear, and other processes
gradually arise from the point where the capitulum of the rib
articulates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata.</span> In the Ungulata vera the thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous. The anterior thoracic
vertebrae commonly have exceedingly high backwardly-projecting
neural spines (fig. 89, 1); but those of the lumbar and
posterior thoracic vertebrae often point somewhat forwards
so that the spines all converge somewhat to a point called the
<i>centre of motion</i> (cp. fig. 101). In the Artiodactyla there are
always nineteen thoraco-lumbar vertebrae, and in the Perissodactyla
twenty-three.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Procavia</i> sometimes has thirty thoraco-lumbar vertebrae, a
greater number than occurs in any other terrestrial mammal;
twenty-two of these are thoracic and eight lumbar. In <i>Phenacodus</i>
the convergence of the neural spines to a centre of
motion is well seen.</p>

<p>In the Proboscidea there are twenty-three thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae, of which nineteen or twenty bear ribs.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> there are generally nineteen thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae but occasionally the number rises as high as
twenty-five. In the Hares (Leporidae) the number is nineteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
twelve or thirteen of which are thoracic. The anterior
thoracic vertebrae have short centra and high backwardly-directed
neural spines, the lumbar vertebrae have large forwardly-
and downwardly-directed transverse processes with
expanded ends. Metapophyses, anapophyses and hypapophyses
are all present. In the Agouti (<i>Dasyprocta</i>) the convergence
of the neural spines to a centre of motion is very strongly
marked.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> the trunk vertebrae are nearly always
twenty or twenty-one in number; in the genera <i>Felis</i> and
<i>Canis</i> thirteen of these are thoracic and seven lumbar. The
anterior thoracic vertebrae have long backwardly-projecting
neural spines, while the posterior thoracic and lumbar vertebrae
have shorter and thicker neural spines which project slightly
forwards. In the Pinnipedia there is no change in the direction
of the neural spines, and anapophyses are but little developed.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the number of trunk vertebrae varies
much from nineteen&mdash;thirteen thoracic and six lumbar&mdash;in
<i>Tupaia</i>, to twenty-four&mdash;nineteen thoracic and five lumbar&mdash;in
<i>Centetes</i>. The development of the various processes varies
in accordance with the habits of the animals, being great in
the active forms, slight in the slowly moving or burrowing
forms. In <i>Talpa</i> and <i>Galeopithecus</i> the intervertebral discs
of the thoraco-lumbar region instead of being cartilaginous
have ossified forming inter centra, a condition met with in
very few mammals.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> there are seventeen or eighteen thoraco-lumbar
vertebrae, eleven to fourteen of which may bear ribs.
The development of processes is slight.</p>

<p>Among <span class="smcap">Primates</span> the number of trunk vertebrae is generally
nineteen, of which twelve to fourteen bear ribs; in man
and the Gorilla and Chimpanzee the number is, however,
seventeen, and in the Orang (<i>Simia</i>) sixteen. In some of the
Lemuroidea there are as many as twenty-three or twenty-four.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
In most cases the neural spines converge more or less to a
centre of motion, and this is especially marked in some of the
Lemurs; it does not occur in man and the anthropoid apes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sacral and caudal vertebrae.</span></p>

<p>At the posterior end of the trunk in all mammals a
certain number of vertebrae are found fused together forming
the sacrum. But of these only two or three answer to the
definition of true sacral vertebrae in being united to the ilia
by small ribs. The others which belong to the caudal series
may be called pseudosacral vertebrae. In different individuals
of the same species it sometimes happens that different
vertebrae are attached to the pelvis and form the sacrum.
Sometimes even different vertebrae are attached to the pelvis
at successive periods in the life history of the individual. This
is owing to a shifting of the pelvis and has been especially
well seen in man. In young human embryos the pelvis is
at a certain stage attached to vertebra 30, but as development
goes on it becomes progressively attached to the twenty-ninth,
twenty-eighth, twenty-seventh, twenty-sixth and twenty-fifth
vertebrae. As the attachment to these anterior vertebrae
is gained, the attachment to the posterior ones becomes
lost, so that in the adult the pelvis is generally attached
to vertebrae 25 and 26. But there are no absolutely pre-determined
sacral vertebrae, as sometimes the pelvis does not
reach vertebra 25, remaining attached to vertebrae 26 and 27;
sometimes it becomes attached even to vertebra 24. This
shifting of the pelvis is seen in <i>Choloepus</i> in a more marked
degree even than in man.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span>, <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> has two sacral vertebrae
ankylosed together, while <i>Echidna</i> has three or four<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span> as a rule only one vertebra is directly
united to the ilia, but one or two more are commonly fused
to the first. In the Wombats there may be as many as four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
or five vertebrae fused together in the sacral region. In
<i>Notoryctes</i> there is extensive fusion in the sacral region, six
vertebrae, owing mainly to the great development of their
metapophyses, being united with one another, and with the
ilia, and the greater part of the ischia.</p>

<p>In most <span class="smcap">Edentata</span> there is an extensive fusion of vertebrae
in the sacral region. This is especially marked in the
Armadillos and Megatheriidae, and to a less extent in the
Sloths and Aard Varks.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the vestigial pelvis is attached by ligament
to the transverse processes of a single vertebra, which hence
may be regarded as sacral.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> there is no sacrum, the vestigial pelvis not
being connected with the vertebral column.</p>

<p>In most <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> the sacrum consists of one large vertebra
united to the ilia, and having a varying number of
smaller vertebrae fused with it behind.</p>

<p>The same arrangement obtains in most <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span>, but in
the Beavers (Castoridae) all the fused vertebrae are of much
the same size, the posterior ones having long transverse
processes which nearly meet the ilia.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> there may be two sacral vertebrae as in the
Hyaena, three as in the Dog, four or five as in Bears and
Seals.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> from three to five are united, while in
many <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> all the sacral and caudal vertebrae have
coalesced. Among <span class="smcap">Primates</span>, in Man and Anthropoid Apes
there are usually five fused vertebrae forming the sacrum,
but of these only two or three are connected to the ilia by ribs.
In most of the other Anthropoidea there are two or three
fused vertebrae, and in the Lemuroidea two to five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Free Caudal Vertebrae.</span> The free caudal vertebrae
vary greatly in number and character. When the tail is well
developed, the anterior vertebrae are comparatively short and
broad, with well-developed neural arches and zygapophyses;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
but as the tail is followed back, the centra gradually
lengthen and become cylindrical, and at the same time the
neural arches and all the processes gradually become reduced
and disappear, so that the last few vertebrae consist of simple
rod-like centra. Chevron bones are frequently well-developed.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Monotremes</span> <i>Echidna</i> has twelve caudal vertebrae,
two of which bear irregular chevron bones. In <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>
there are twenty or twenty-one caudal vertebrae with
well-developed hypapophyses, but no chevron bones.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Marsupials</span> there is great diversity as regards the tail.
In the Wombat and Koala the tail is small and without
chevron bones. In most other Marsupials it is very long,
having sometimes as many as thirty-five vertebrae in the
prehensile-tailed opossums. In the Kangaroos the tail is very
large and stout. Chevron bones are almost always present, and
in <i>Notoryctes</i> are large and expanded.</p>

<p>Most <span class="smcap">Edentates</span> have large tails with well-developed
chevron bones. The length of the tail varies greatly from the
rudimentary condition in Sloths to that in the Pangolins, one
of which has forty-six to forty-nine caudal vertebrae&mdash;the
largest number in any known mammal. Chevron bones are
much developed, sometimes they are Y-shaped, sometimes as in
<i>Priodon</i>, they have strong diverging processes. The caudal
vertebrae of Glyptodonts, though enclosed in a continuous
bony sheath, have not become ankylosed together.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> have numerous caudal vertebrae with wide
transverse processes. In the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> also the tail is much
developed, and the anterior vertebrae have large chevron
bones and prominent straight transverse processes; the posterior
caudal vertebrae, which in life are enclosed in the horizontally
expanded tail fin, are without transverse processes.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> the tail is simple, formed of short cylindrical
vertebrae, which in living forms are never provided with
chevron bones. The number of caudal vertebrae varies from
four, sometimes met with in <i>Procavia</i>, to thirty-one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
Elephant. The tail is exceedingly long in <i>Anoplotherium</i> and
in <i>Phenacodus</i>, in which there are thirty caudal vertebrae.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the tail is variable. In the Hares, Guinea
pig (<i>Cavia</i>) and <i>Capybara</i> it is very small, in <i>Pedetes</i> and the
Beaver it is very long and has well-developed chevron bones.</p>

<p>Most of the <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> except the Bears and Seals have
very long tails, the greatest number of vertebrae, thirty-six,
being met with in <i>Paradoxurus</i>. Bears have only eight to
ten caudal vertebrae. Chevron bones are not often much
developed.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the tail is very variable as regards length,
the number of vertebrae varying from eight in <i>Centetes</i> to
forty-three in <i>Microgale</i>.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the tail is sometimes quite rudimentary,
and as in <i>Pteropus</i>, composed of a few coalesced vertebrae,
sometimes it is formed of a large number of slender vertebrae.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Primates</span> also the tail is very variable. In Man all
the four caudal vertebrae are rudimentary and are fused
together, forming the <i>coccyx</i>. In the Anthropoid apes, too,
there are only four or five caudal vertebrae. In many
monkeys of both the eastern and western hemispheres the
tail is very long, having thirty-three vertebrae in <i>Ateles</i>, in
which genus it is also prehensile. Chevron bones are present
in all Primates with well-developed tails. In the Lemuroidea
the number of caudal vertebrae varies from seven to twenty-nine.</p>

<small>GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SKELETON IN MAMMALIA (<span class="smcap">continued</span>).</small></h2>


<p class="cen">THE SKULL AND APPENDICULAR SKELETON.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Skull.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monotremata.</span> In both genera the cranium is thin-walled,
has a fairly large cavity, and is very smooth and rounded externally.
The sutures between many of the bones early become
obliterated in a manner comparable to that in birds, and the
facial portion of the skull is much prolonged.</p>

<p>In <i>Echidna</i> the face is drawn out into a gradually tapering
rostrum, formed mainly by the premaxillae, maxillae and nasals.
The zygomatic arch is very weak, and the palate extends very
far back. The tympanic forms a slender ring. The mandible
is extremely slight, with no ascending portion, and but slight
traces of the coronoid process and angle. The hyoid has a
wide basi-hyal and stout thyro-hyals, while the anterior cornua
are slender, and include ossified epi-hyals and cerato-hyals.</p>

<p>In <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> the zygomatic arch is much stouter
than in <i>Echidna</i>. The face is produced into a wide beak,
mainly supported by the premaxillae, between whose diverging
anterior ends there is a dumb-bell-shaped bone. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>maxillae
are flattened below, and each bears a large horny tooth, which
meets a corresponding structure borne on a surface near the
middle of the mandible. The mandible is considerably stouter
than in <i>Echidna</i>, but the angle and coronoid process are but
little developed. The infra-orbital foramen and the inferior
dental and mental foramina of the mandible are all very large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marsupialia.</span> The skulls of the various types of the
Marsupials frequently bear a strong superficial resemblance to
those of some of the different groups of placental mammals.
Thus the skull of the Dasyuridae resembles that of the Carnivora,
the resemblance being most marked between the skulls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
<i>Thylacinus</i> and the dog. The skull of <i>Notoryctes</i> is strongly suggestive
of that of an Insectivore, and that of other Marsupials
such as the wombat, recalls equally the characteristic features
of a Rodent's skull. But, however much they may differ from
one another, the skulls of all Marsupials agree in the following
respects. (1) The brain cavity, and especially the cerebral
fossa, has a very small comparative size. (2) The nasals are
always large, and the mesethmoid is extensively ossified, and
terminated by a prominent vertical edge. (3) Processes from
the jugal and frontal in living forms never meet and enclose
the orbit, but the zygomatic arch is always complete. (4) The
jugal always extends back to form part of the glenoid fossa.
(5) The lachrymal canal opens either external to or upon the
margin of the orbit, and the nasal processes of the premaxillae
never quite reach the frontals. (6) The posterior part of the
palate is commonly pierced by large oval vacuities. (7) The
tympanic is small and never fused to the bones of the
cranium. (8) The carotid canal perforates the basisphenoid
and not the tympanic bulla. (9) The optic foramen and
sphenoidal fissure are confluent. (10) In every case except
<i>Tarsipes</i> the angle of the mandible is more or less inflected.</p>

<p>The skull of the extinct <i>Thylacoleo</i> differs from that of all
other Marsupials in the fact that the postorbital bar is complete.
The hyoid is constructed on much the same plan in all
Marsupials. It consists of a small basi-hyal, a pair of broad
cerato-hyals, and a pair of strong thyro-hyals. The epi-hyals
and stylo-hyals are generally unossified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edentata.</span> In Sloths (Bradypodidae) the sutures become
early obliterated, the cranial portion of the skull is rather
high, and the facial portion very short. The lachrymal is very
small, and its canal opens outside the orbit. The zygomatic
arch is incomplete, and the jugal (fig. 91, 5) is curiously forked,
but in a manner differing in the two genera. The premaxillae
are very small,&mdash;in <i>Bradypus</i> quite vestigial. The mandible is
well developed, the angle being specially marked in <i>Bradypus</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
In <i>Choloepus</i> the symphysial part is drawn out in a somewhat
spout-like manner (fig. 91, 6). In both genera the thyro-hyals
are ankylosed with the basi-hyal.</p>

<p>In <i>Megatherium</i> the general appearance of the skull is
distinctly sloth-like, but the facial portion is more elongated,
partly owing to the development of a prenasal bone, and the
zygomatic arch is complete. The mandible is very deep in the
middle, and is drawn out into a long spout-like process in front.</p>

<p>Anteaters (Myrmecophagidae) have a much modified skull,
and this is especially the case in the Great Anteater, <i>Myrmecophaga</i>.
The skull is smooth and evenly-rounded, in these
respects recalling that of <i>Echidna</i>, but it is longer and tapers
much more gradually than in <i>Echidna</i>. The occipital condyles
are remarkably large. The premaxillae are small, and the
long rostrum is chiefly composed of the maxillae and nasals
with the mesethmoid and vomer. The zygomatic arch is
incomplete, and there is no trace of a separation between the
orbit and the temporal fossa. The palate is much elongated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
the pterygoids meeting in the middle line just like the palatines.
The mandible is very long and slender, there being no
definite coronoid process, and a short and slight symphysis.
The hyoid arch is noticeable for the length of the anterior
cornu.</p>

<p>In the Armadillos (Dasypodidae) the skull varies a good
deal in shape, but the facial portion is always tapering and
depressed. The zygomatic arch is complete. In <i>Dasypus</i> and
<i>Chlamydophorus</i> the tympanic bulla is well ossified.</p>

<p>In the Glyptodontidae the skull is very short and deep;
the zygomatic arch is complete, and has a long downwardly
projecting maxillary process. The mandible is massive, and
has a very high ascending portion.</p>

<p>In the Manidae the skull is smooth and rounded, the zygomatic
arch is incomplete, and the orbit is inconspicuous. The
palate is long and narrow, but the pterygoids do not take part
in its formation. The mandible is slightly developed and has
no angle or coronoid process.</p>

<p>In <i>Orycteropus</i> the zygomatic arch is complete, and there
is a small postorbital process to the frontal. The mandible is
well-developed, having a coronoid process and definite ascending
portion, and the hyoid is well ossified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sirenia.</span> The skull, and especially the brain case of all
Sirenia, is remarkable for the general density of the component
bones, which, though often very thick, are without air sinuses.
It is noticeable also for the roughness of the bones, and the
irregular manner in which they are united together.</p>

<p>The cranial cavity is decidedly small, the reduction being
specially noticeable in the cerebral fossa, which is not much
larger than the cerebellar fossa. The foramen magnum is
large, and the dorsal surface of the cranium narrow. The
zygomatic arch is very strongly developed, the squamosal (fig.
92, 4) being especially prominent, and being drawn out not only
into the zygomatic process, but also into a large post-tympanic
process which articulates with the exoccipital. At the side<span class="pagenum">[460]</span>
of the skull between the squamosal, supra-occipital and exoccipital,
there is a wide vacuity in the cranial wall, partially filled
up by the very large periotic, which is ankylosed to the tympanic,
but is not united to any other bones of the skull. The
foramen lacerum medium is confluent with the foramen lacerum
anterius, and the two together form an enormous vacuity on
the floor of the skull, bounded chiefly by the exoccipital, basi-occipital,
alisphenoid and squamosal. The jugal (fig. 92, 8) is
large and in <i>Manatus</i> sends up a strong process, which nearly
or quite meets the postorbital process of the frontal, completing
the orbit. In the other Sirenia the orbit is completely confluent
with the very large temporal fossa. The lachrymal in <i>Manatus</i>
is very small, but is larger in <i>Halicore</i>. The premaxillae (fig.
92, 9) are large, but smaller in <i>Manatus</i> than in the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
genera, in all of which they are curiously bent down in front.
Their upper margin forms the anterior border of a very large
aperture lying high on the roof of the skull and extending
back for a considerable distance. This aperture is formed by
the union of the two anterior nares. The nasals are quite
vestigial or absent, and the narial aperture is bounded above
by the frontals; in its floor are seen the slender vomer and
large mesethmoid. The palate is long and narrow, and formed
mainly by the maxillae; behind it there is a large irregular
process formed by the union of the palatine, pterygoid, and
pterygoid plate of the alisphenoid. The mandible is very
massive and has a very high ascending portion, a rounded
angle (fig. 92, 10), and a prominent coronoid process; the two
rami are firmly ankylosed together. The hyoid consists principally
of the broad flat basi-hyal; the anterior cornua are but
slightly ossified, while the thyro-hyals are not ossified at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cetacea.</span> The skull in all Cetacea, especially in the Odontoceti,
is a good deal modified from the ordinary mammalian
type.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Archaeoceti</span></i> this modification is less marked than
in either of the other suborders. The nasals and premaxillae
are a good deal larger than they are in living forms, and the
anterior nares are placed further forward. The maxillae do
not extend back over the frontals, and there is a well-marked
sagittal crest.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Mystacoceti</span></i> the skull is always quite bilaterally
symmetrical, and is not so much modified from the ordinary
mammalian type as in the Odontoceti. The parietals are not,
as in the Odontoceti, separated by a wide interparietal, but
meet; they are, however, hidden under the very large supra-occipital.
The nasals are developed to a certain extent, and
the nares, though placed very far back and near the top of the
head, terminate forwardly-directed narial passages. Turbinal
bones are also developed to some extent; this fact, and the
occurrence of a definite though small olfactory fossa constituting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
important distinctions from the Odontoceti. The maxillae are
large, but do not extend back to cover the frontals as in the
Odontoceti. The zygomatic process of the squamosal is very
large. The mandibular rami are not compressed, but are
rounded and arched outwards, and never meet in a long
symphysis.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Odontoceti.</span></i> The skull departs widely from the ordinary
mammalian type. The following description will apply to any
of the following genera of the Delphinidae, <i>Phocaena</i>, <i>Globicephalus</i>,
<i>Lagenorhynchus</i>, <i>Delphinus</i>, <i>Tursiops</i>, <i>Prodelphinus</i>,
<i>Sotalia</i>.</p>

<p>The upper surface of the skull is more or less asymmetrical.
The cerebral cavity is high, short and broad; and formed mainly
by the cerebral fossa, the olfactory fossa being entirely absent.
The supra-occipital (fig. 93, 3) is very large, and forms much
of the posterior part of the roof of the skull. It has the
interparietal (fig. 93, 7) fused with it, and completely separates
the two parietals. The frontal (fig. 93, 10) is large and laterally
expanded, forming the roof of the orbit, but is almost
completely covered by an extension of the maxillae. The
zygomatic arch is very slender, and is mainly formed by a
rod-like process from the jugal (fig. 93, 15), the zygomatic
process of the squamosal being short and stout.</p>

<p>The nasal passages are peculiarly modified, instead of
passing horizontally forwards above the roof of the mouth,
they pass upwards and even somewhat backwards towards
the top of the skull (fig. 93, 23). They are bounded laterally
by two processes from the premaxillae, the left of which is
shorter than the right. The nasal cavities are narrow and
without turbinals and the nasals (fig. 93, 19) are almost as
much reduced as in Sirenia.</p>

<p>In front of the nasal openings the face is prolonged as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
narrow beak or rostrum of varying length, formed by the
maxillae and premaxillae surrounding the vomer and large
mesethmoid (fig. 93, 11), which sends forwards a long partially
cartilaginous process, and is fused behind with the presphenoid
(fig. 93, 8). The basi-occipital (fig. 93, 1) too is fused with
the basisphenoid. The foramen rotundum is confluent with
the sphenoidal fissure, and the foramen ovale with the foramen
lacerum medium and the foramen lacerum posterius. The
palate is mainly formed by the maxillae; the premaxillae and
palatines (fig. 93, 17), though both meet in symphyses, forming
very little of it. The pterygoids vary in size in the different
genera, sometimes as in <i>Lagenorhynchus</i> and <i>Delphinus</i> meeting
in the middle line, sometimes as in <i>Phocaena</i> and <i>Globicephalus</i>
(fig. 93, 18) being widely separated. The tympanic
and periotic are not fused together, and the periotic has
generally no bony union with the rest of the skull. The
mandible is rather slightly developed, with the rami straight,
compressed and tapering to the anterior end. The condyle is
not raised at all above the edge of the ramus; the angle is
rounded and the coronoid process is very small. <i>Platanista</i> has
a curiously modified skull; the rostrum and mandible are
exceedingly long and narrow, and arising from the maxillae
are two great plates of bone which nearly meet above.</p>

<p>In the Physeteridae the skull is raised into a very prominent
crest at the vertex behind the nares. In front of this
in <i>Hyperoödon</i> a pair of ridges occur, formed by outgrowths
from the maxillae. In the old male these ridges reach an
enormous size and almost meet in the middle line. In <i>Physeter</i>,
the Sperm whale, these ridges are not developed; the
maxillae and premaxillae unite with the other bones of the
crest enclosing an enormous half basin-shaped cavity, at the
base of which are the very asymmetrical anterior narial apertures.</p>

<p>In all living Cetacea the hyoid has the same general shape,
consisting firstly of a crescentic bone formed by the fusion
of the thyro-hyals with the basi-hyal, and secondly of the
anterior cornu formed principally by the strong stylo-hyal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata.</span> None of the distinctive characters separating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
the Ungulata from the other groups of mammals are drawn
from the skull. But in the Ungulata vera as opposed to the
Subungulata a distinguishing feature is found in the fact that
the lachrymal and jugal form a considerable part of the side
of the face, and that the jugal always forms the anterior part
of the zygomatic arch, the maxillae taking no part in it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata vera.</span></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Artiodactyla.</span></i> The skull in Artiodactyla differs from that
in Perissodactyla in the fact that the posterior end of the
nasal is not expanded and there is no alisphenoid canal.</p>

<p>The skulls in the different groups of Artiodactyla differ
considerably from one another.</p>

<p>The skull of the Pig<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> will be described as illustrative of the
skull in the Suina. In the Pig as in most Artiodactyla the
face is bent sharply down on the basicranial axis, the commencement
of the vomer being situated below the mesethmoid
instead of in front of it as in most skulls. The occipital region
of the skull is small, and the line of junction of the supra-occipital
and parietals is raised into a prominent occipital crest.
The parietal completely fuses at an early stage with its fellow,
and the exoccipital is drawn out into a long paroccipital process
(fig. 94, A, 8). The frontal is large and broad and drawn out
into a small postorbital process. The lachrymal too is large and
takes a considerable part in forming the side of the face in front
of the orbit, as does also the jugal, though to a less extent.
The face is long and tapers much anteriorly. The nasals are
long and narrow, as are the nasal processes of the premaxillae,
which do not however reach the frontals. A prenasal ossicle
is developed in front of the mesethmoid. The palate is long
and narrow, the pterygoid (fig. 94, A, 10) is small, but the
pterygoid process of the alisphenoid is prominent. The
squamosal is small and has the tympanic fused with it; the
tympanic is dilated below, forming a bulla (fig. 94, A, 9) filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
with cancellous bone, and above forms the floor of a long upwardly-directed
auditory meatus. The mandible has a high
ascending portion and a small coronoid process (fig. 94, B, 13).
The hyoid differs from that of most Ungulates, the stylo-hyal
being very imperfectly ossified.</p>

<p>In <i>Hippopotamus</i> the skull though essentially like that of
the pig is much modified in detail. The brain cavity is very
small, while the jaws are immensely developed. The face contracts
in front of the orbits and then expands again greatly,
to lodge the enormous incisor and canine teeth. The postorbital
bar is complete or nearly so, and the orbits project curiously
outwards and slightly upwards; the lachrymal is thin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
much dilated. The squamosal is drawn out into a postglenoid
process, and the hamular process of the pterygoid is prominent.
The tympanic bulla is filled with cancellous bone. The mandible
is enormously large, the symphysis is long, the angle much
expanded and drawn out into a process which projects outwards
and forwards.</p>

<p>Among extinct forms related to the Suina, <i>Cyclopidius</i> is
noticeable for having large vacuities in the lachrymo-nasal
region, while <i>Cotylops</i> has the postorbital bar complete; both
these forms are from the North American Miocene.</p>

<p>In the Tylopoda and Tragulina the skull resembles in most
respects that of the Ruminants, shortly to be described; but it
is allied to that of the Suina in having the tympanic bulla filled
with cancellous bone. The tympanic bulla is better developed
in the Tragulina than in most Ungulates.</p>

<p>Among Ruminants, the Bovidae, that large group including
the Oxen, Sheep, and Antelopes, as a rule have the face
bent on the basicranial axis much as in the Suina. The
parietals are generally small and early coalesce, the frontals
are large and are usually drawn out into horn cores, which are
however absent in the skulls of some domestic varieties of sheep
and oxen, and also in some of the earlier extinct forms of Bovidae.
These horn cores are formed internally of cancellous
bone, and on them the true epidermal horns are borne. In
young animals there is a distinct interparietal, but this early
fuses with the supra-occipital, and in the oxen also with the
parietals. The occipital crest is generally well marked, but
in the genus <i>Bos</i> becomes merged in a very prominent straight
ridge running between the two horn cores; this ridge, which
contains air cells communicating with those in the horn cores, is
not nearly so well marked in <i>Bison</i>. There is often, as in <i>Gazella</i>,
a vacuity on the side of the face between the nasal, frontal,
lachrymal, and maxillae, but this is not found in oxen or sheep.
The premaxillae are small, the nasals are long and pointed,
and the turbinals are much developed. The Saiga antelope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
has a curiously specialised skull; the nasals are absent or
have coalesced with the frontals and the anterior nares are
enormously large. In all Ruminants the lachrymal is large
and forms a considerable part of the side of the face; it often
bears a considerable depression, the <i>suborbital</i> or <i>lachrymal
fossa</i>, well seen in most of the smaller antelopes. The postorbital
bar is complete, and the orbit is prominent and nearly
circular. The palatines and pterygoids are moderately large,
and the pterygoids have a backwardly-projecting hamular process.
The squamosal is small, but has a postglenoid process.
The tympanic is not fused to the periotic and has a small bulla
not filled with cancellous bone. There is a large paroccipital
process to the exoccipital and the mandible has a long slender
coronoid process.</p>

<p>In the Cervidae and Giraffidae the face is not bent down
on the basicranial axis as it is in the Bovidae. The frontals are
drawn out, not into permanent horn cores as in the Bovidae,
but into short outgrowths, the pedicels, upon which in the
Cervidae long antlers are annually developed. These <i>antlers</i> are
outgrowths of bone, and are covered during development by
vascular integument, which dries up and peels off when growth
is complete. Every year they are detached, by a process of
absorption at the base, and shed. They may occur in both sexes,
as in the Reindeer, but as a rule they are found only in the
male. They are generally more or less branched, and are sometimes
of enormous size and weight, as in the extinct <i>Cervus megaceros</i>.
In young animals they are always simple, but become
annually more and more complicated as the animal grows older.</p>

<p>In the Giraffe the frontals bear a small pair of bony cores,
which are at first distinct, but subsequently become fused to
the skull. In the allied <i>Sivatherium</i>, a very large form from
the Indian Pliocene, the skull bears two pairs of bony outgrowths,
a pair of short conical outgrowths above the orbits,
and a pair of large expanded outgrowths on the occiput.</p>

<p>The opening of the lachrymal canal is commonly double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
and the lachrymal fossa is large in the Cervidae and the Giraffidae
except <i>Sivatherium</i>. The vacuity between the frontal,
lachrymal, maxillae, and nasal is specially large.</p>

<p>The hyoid of Ruminants is noticeable for the development
of the anterior cornua, which include stout and short cerato-hyals
and epi-hyals, long and strong stylo-hyals and large
tympano-hyals which are more or less imbedded in the tympanics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Perissodactyla.</i></span> In the skull of Perissodactyles an alisphenoid
canal is found and the nasals are expanded behind.
Among the living animals belonging to this group the skull least
modified from the ordinary type is that in <i>Rhinoceros</i>. In this
form the skull is considerably elongated, the facial portion being
very large. The occipital region is elevated, but the cranial
cavity is small, the boundary line between the occipital and
parietal regions being drawn out into a prominent crest, which
is occupied by air cells. There is no postorbital process to the
frontal, and the orbit is completely confluent with the temporal
fossa. The nasals are fused together and are very strongly
developed, extending far forwards, sometimes considerably
beyond the premaxillae. In some extinct species, such as <i>Elasmotherium</i>
and the Tichorhine Rhinoceros, <i>R. antiquitatis</i>, the
mesethmoid is ossified as far forwards as the end of the nasals.
The nasals are arched and bear one or two roughened surfaces
to which the great nasal horns are attached. The premaxillae
are very small and the pterygoids are slender. The palate is
long, narrow, and deeply excavated behind. The postglenoid
process of the squamosal is well developed, and generally
longer than the paroccipital process of the exoccipital. The
tympanic and periotic are both small and are fused together.
The condyle of the mandible is very wide, the angle rounded,
and the coronoid process moderately developed.</p>

<p>In the Titanotheriidae, a family of extinct Perissodactyla
from the Miocene of North America, the occipital region is much
elevated, as is also the fronto-nasal region, the nasals (perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
only in the male) bearing a pair of blunt bony outgrowths.
Between these two elevated regions the skull is much depressed.
The cranial cavity is very small, the orbit confluent
with the temporal fossa, and the zygomatic arch massive.</p>

<p>In <i>Tapirus</i> the orbit and temporal fossa are confluent.
The nasals are small, wide behind and pointed in front, and
are supported by the mesethmoid; the anterior nares are
exceedingly large and their lateral boundaries are entirely
formed by the maxillae. The postglenoid and post-tympanic
processes of the squamosal are large. The periotic is not fused
to the squamosal or to the small tympanic. The mandible is
large and has the angle much developed and somewhat inflected.</p>

<p><i>Palaeotherium</i>, which lived in early Tertiary times, has a
skull much like that of the Tapir, especially as regards the
nasal bones.</p>

<p>In the Horse and its allies (Equidae) the facial portion of
the skull is very large as compared with the cranial portion,
the nasals and nasal cavities being specially large. In the
living species of the genus <i>Equus</i> there is no fossa between the
maxillae and lachrymal, but it occurs in some extinct species.
The lachrymal and jugal form a considerable part of the side
of the face; and the orbit though small is complete and prominent.
The postorbital bar is formed by a strong outgrowth
from the frontal, which unites with a forward extension of the
squamosal. The squamosal may extend forwards and form
part of the wall of the orbit, a very unusual feature, as in most
mammals the squamosal stops before the postorbital bar. The
palate is narrow and excavated behind as in <i>Rhinoceros</i>; the
palatines take very little part in its formation. The glenoid
surface for the articulation of the mandible is very wide. The
squamosal gives rise to small postglenoid and post-tympanic
processes, and the exoccipital to a large paroccipital process.
The tympanic and periotic are ankylosed together, but not to
any other bones.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Subungulata</span>, the lachrymal and jugal do not form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
any considerable part of the side of the face, and the maxillae
commonly takes part in the formation of the zygomatic arch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Toxodontia.</i></span> The skull in the Toxodontia shows several
Artiodactyloid features, while the manus and pes are of a more
Perissodactyloid type. The Artiodactyloid features are (1) the
absence of an alisphenoid canal, (2) the fact that the palate is
not excavated behind, and that the palatines form a considerable
part of it, and (3) the fusion of the tympanic to the
squamosal and exoccipital, forming the floor of an upwardly
directed auditory meatus. The frontal has a fairly well developed
postorbital process, but the orbit is confluent with the
temporal fossa. The premaxillae is well developed, as is the paroccipital
process of the exoccipital, especially in <i>Typotherium</i>.
The mandible has a rounded angle and a coronoid process of
moderate size. In <i>Typotherium</i> the ascending portion is very
massive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Condylarthra.</i></span> As far as is known the skull of these
generalised Ungulates is depressed, and is frequently marked
by a strong sagittal crest. The cranial cavity is small, the
cerebral fossa in <i>Phenacodus</i> being exceptionally small. The
orbit is completely confluent with the temporal fossa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Hyracoidea.</i></span> The skull of <i>Procavia</i> resembles that of
Perissodactyles more than that of any other Ungulates, but
differs strongly in the comparatively small size of its facial
portion. The posterior portion of the cranium is rather high,
the occipital plane being nearly vertical. There is a small
interparietal. The nasals are wide behind, and the zygomatic
arch is strongly developed, its most anterior part being formed
by the maxillae. The jugal and parietal give rise to postorbital
processes which sometimes meet, but as a rule the orbit
is confluent with the temporal fossa; it is very uncommon
for the parietal to give rise to a postorbital process, and even
in <i>Procavia</i> the frontal often forms part of the process. The
alisphenoid canal, and postglenoid and paroccipital processes
are well developed. The tympanic bulla is large and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
periotic and tympanic are fused together, but not as a rule
to the squamosal. The ascending portion of the mandible is
very high and broad, the angle rounded and the coronoid
process moderate in size. The hyoid is singular, there is a
large flat basi-hyal prolonged laterally into two broad flattened
thyro-hyals. Articulating with its anterior end are two large
triangular cerato-hyals, which are drawn out into two processes
meeting in the middle line.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Amblypoda.</span></i> In the Uintatheriidae (Dinocerata) the skull
has a very remarkable character, being long and narrow and
drawn out into three pairs of rounded protuberances, a small
pair on the nasals, a larger pair on the maxillae in front of the
orbits, and the largest pair on the parietals. The cranial cavity,
and especially the cerebral fossa, is extraordinarily small. The
orbit is not divided behind from the temporal fossa. The
mandible has a prominent angle, and a long curved coronoid
process; its symphysial portion bears a curious flattened outgrowth
to protect the great upper canines.</p>

<p>In <i>Coryphodon</i> the skull is of a more normal character,
being without the conspicuous protuberances. The cranial
cavity though very small is not so small as in <i>Uintatherium</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Proboscidea.</span></i> The character of the skull in the young elephant
differs much from that in the old animal. In very young
individuals the skull is of a normal character, and the cranial
cavity is distinctly large in proportion to the bulk of the skull.
But as the animal gets older, while its brain does not grow
much, the size of its trunk and especially of its tusks increases
greatly; and consequently the skull wall is required to be of
very great superficial extent in order to afford space for the
attachment of the muscles necessary for the support of these
heavy weights. This increase in superficial extent is brought
about without much increase in weight of bone by the development
of an enormous number of air cells in nearly all the
bones of the skull; sometimes, as in the case of the frontal,
separating the inner wall of the bone from the outer, by as<span class="pagenum">[474]</span>
much as a foot. This development of air cells is accompanied
by the obliteration of the sutures between the various bones.
The most noticeable point with regard to the cranial cavity
is the comparatively large size of the olfactory fossa. The
supra-occipital (figs. 96 and 97, 9) is large&mdash;exceedingly large
in the adult skull; the parietals (figs. 96 and 97, 2) are also
very large. The frontals send out small postorbital processes,
but these do not meet processes from the small jugal, which<span class="pagenum">[475]</span>
forms only the middle part of the slender zygomatic arch, the
anterior part being formed by the maxillae. The lachrymal
(fig. 96, 15) is small and lies almost entirely inside the orbit.
The anterior narial aperture (fig. 97, 8) is wide and directed
upwards, opening high on the anterior surface of the skull. It
is bounded above by the short thick nasals and below by the
premaxillae. The narial passage is freely open, maxillo-turbinals
not being developed. The palatine is well developed,
the pterygoid is small and early fuses with the pterygoid
process of the alisphenoid. The tympanic is united with the
periotic but not with the squamosal, and forms a large auditory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
bulla. There are no paroccipital or postglenoid processes.
The exoccipital is not perforated by the condylar foramen,&mdash;a
very exceptional condition.</p>

<p>The mandible has a high ascending portion, is rounded off
below and has no angle. The symphysial portion is long,
narrow, and spout-like, and the coronoid process is small.
The thyro-hyals are ankylosed with the basi-hyal, which is
connected with the large forked stylo-hyals by ligament only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodentia.</span> The cranial cavity is depressed, elongated, and
rather small, and the cerebral fossa lies entirely in front of the
cerebellar fossa. The occipital plane is vertical or directed
somewhat backwards, and the supra-occipital does not form
much of the roof of the cranium. The paroccipital processes
of the exoccipitals are generally of moderate size; in the
Capybara (<i>Hydrochaerus</i>), however, they are very long, and
are laterally compressed and directed forwards. The parietals
are small, and often become completely fused together; there
is sometimes a small interparietal. The frontals in most genera
have no trace of a postorbital process; in Squirrels, Marmots
and Hares, however, one occurs, but in no case does it meet a
corresponding process from the zygomatic arch, so the orbit
and temporal fossa are completely confluent. In Hares the
postorbital process of the frontal is much flattened, and has
an irregular margin. The temporal fossa is always small, and
in <i>Lophiomys</i> is arched over by plates arising respectively
from the parietal and jugal; a secondary roof is thus partially
developed in a manner unique among mammals, but carried
to a great extent in many Chelonia. The nasal bones and
cavities are large, attaining their maximum development in
the Porcupines (fig. 98, 1). The premaxillae is always very
large, and sends back a long process which meets the frontal.
The vomer is occasionally found persisting in two separate
halves, a feature recalling the arrangement in Sauropsids. In
many Rodents there is an enormous vacuity at the base of the
maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch. It is sometimes as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
large as the orbit, and attains its maximum development in
the Capybara and other Hystricomorpha; in the Marmots,
Beavers, and Squirrels (Sciuromorpha), and in the Hares it is
undeveloped. In <i>Lagostomus</i> the maxillae bears an upwardly
directed plate of bone, shutting off from this vacuity a space
which is the true infra-orbital foramen.</p>

<p>The zygomatic arch is always complete, and in many cases
the jugal extends back to form part at least of the glenoid
surface for articulation with the mandible. In <i>Coelogenys</i> the
jugal and maxillary portion of the zygomatic arch is greatly
expanded and roughened, and the maxillary portion encloses a
large cavity. The palate in Rodents is narrow, and the space
between the incisor and molar teeth passes imperceptibly
into the sides of the face. The anterior palatine foramina
form long, rather narrow slits in this region. The bony
palate between the grinding teeth is sometimes as in the Hares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
very short, sometimes as in the Capybara very long. The
maxillae extends back beneath the orbit to unite with the
squamosal. The pterygoid is always small, but sometimes
has a well-marked hamular process which in <i>Hystrix</i>, <i>Lagostomus</i>,
and some other genera unites with the tympanic bulla.
The periotic is large, and fused with the tympanic, which
forms a prominent bulla, and is generally drawn out into a
tubular meatus. The bulla attains its maximum development
in <i>Chinchilla</i> and <i>Dipus</i>.</p>

<p>The mandible is narrow and rounded in front, the two
halves meeting in a long symphysis. The angle is generally
drawn out into a long backwardly-projecting process, which is
often pointed and directed upwards. In the Hares the angle
is rounded. The coronoid process is never large.</p>

<p>There are a number of points in which the skull of the
Duplicidentata (Hares and Rabbits) differs from that of other
Rodents. (<i>a</i>) The sutures between the basi-occipital and
basisphenoid, and between the basisphenoid and presphenoid
remain open throughout life. (<i>b</i>) Much of the maxillae forming
the side of the face in front of the orbit is fenestrated. (<i>c</i>) The
optic foramina are united to form a single hole, much as in
birds. (<i>d</i>) The coronoid process is slightly differentiated from
the ascending portion of the mandible. The first two of these
points have been thought to indicate degradation of the
hares and rabbits as compared with higher mammals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnivora<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</span> It is characteristic of the skull in Carnivora
that the glenoid fossa is deep, and the postglenoid process
(fig. 75, 23) well developed. The condyle of the mandible is
much elongated transversely. The orbit and temporal fossa
in the great majority of forms communicate freely, the postorbital
bar being incomplete.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Carnivora vera.</span></i> The axis of the facial portion of the
skull is a direct continuation of that of the cranial portion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
The cranial cavity though rather depressed is large, and
generally long, though in Cats it is comparatively short and
wide. The occipital plane is nearly vertical, and the exoccipitals
are developed into fairly prominent paroccipital processes.
The interparietal is commonly distinct, and the parietals unite
in a long sagittal suture, which is often developed into a crest.
The nasals (fig. 73, 4) are well developed, especially in Cats, and
the nasal processes of the premaxillae do not nearly reach the
frontals. A considerable part of the palate is formed by the
palatine, and the maxillary portion is pierced by rather long
anterior palatine foramina. The pterygoid has a hamular
process. The zygomatic arch is strong, especially in Cats.
Postorbital processes are developed on the frontal (fig. 73,
10) and jugal, but never form a complete postorbital bar. A
carotid canal is well seen in the Ursidae, and to a less extent
in the Felidae; in the Canidae there is an alisphenoid canal
(fig. 75, 21).</p>

<p>The auditory bulla differs a good deal in the different
groups. In the Bears (Ursidae) it is not much inflated, and
is most prominent along its inner border; it is not closely connected
with the paroccipital process. In the Cats it is very
prominent, and its cavity is almost divided by a septum into
two parts, the inner of which contains the auditory ossicles.
The paroccipital process is closely applied to the bulla. In the
Dogs the bulla is intermediate in character between that of
the Cats and that of the Bears; it is partially divided by a
septum, and is moderately expanded.</p>

<p>The mandible is well developed with a prominent angle
(fig. 72, 26), and a large coronoid process. The hyoid consists
of a broad basi-hyal, a long many-jointed anterior cornu and
short thyro-hyals (fig. 72, 33).</p>

<p>The skull in the <i><span class="smcap">Creodonta</span></i> is in most respects allied to
that of the Canidae, but presents some ursine affinities. The
tympanic bulla is fairly prominent, but has no well-developed
septum. The cranial cavity is very small and narrow, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
zygomatic arch standing away from it. The temporal fossa is
of great size.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Pinnipedia</span></i> the cranial cavity is large and rounded.
The skull is much compressed in the interorbital region, and
in correlation with this compression the ethmo-turbinals are
little developed, while the maxillo-turbinals are large. The
orbit is large, and the temporal fossa smaller than in the
Carnivora vera. In the Walrus (<i>Trichechus</i>) the anterior part
of the face is distorted by the development of the huge canines.
The Otariidae have an alisphenoid canal. The tympanic bulla
is small in <i>Otaria</i>, large in the Phocidae, and flattened in the
Walrus. The hyoid is similar to that in Carnivora vera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Insectivora.</span> The skull varies much in the different members
of the order Insectivora, but the following points of
agreement are found. The cranial cavity is of small size, and
is never much elevated. The facial part of the skull is generally
considerably elongated, and the nasals and premaxillae are
well developed. The zygomatic arch is usually slender or
incomplete, and the coronoid process and angle of the mandible
are commonly prominent.</p>

<p>In some Insectivora, such as <i>Galeopithecus</i>, <i>Tupaia</i>, and
<i>Macroscelides</i>, the skull shows a higher type of structure
than is met with in most members of the order. In these
genera the cranial cavity is comparatively large, and the
occipital plane is nearly vertical. The zygomatic arch is fairly
strong, and the frontal and jugal give rise to postorbital processes
which nearly or quite (<i>Tupaia</i>) meet. The tympanic
bulla is well developed, and produced into a tubular auditory
meatus, this being specially well marked in <i>Macroscelides</i>.</p>

<p>In the other Insectivora the cranial cavity is of smaller
comparative size, and the orbit and temporal fossa are completely
confluent, often without any trace of a postorbital
bar. The occipital plane commonly slopes forwards. In
the Hedgehogs (Erinaceidae) and Centetidae the tympanic is
very slightly developed, forming a small ring. The zygomatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
arch of Hedgehogs and <i>Gymnura</i> is very slender, the jugal
being but little developed and the squamosal and maxillae
meeting one another; in the Centetidae the jugal is absent
and the arch is incomplete.</p>

<p>The Moles (Talpidae) have an elongated, depressed and
rounded skull with a very slender zygomatic arch formed by
the squamosal and maxillae. The nasals are fused together,
and the mesethmoid is ossified very far forwards. In the
Shrews (Soricidae) there is no zygomatic arch; the tympanic
is ring-like, and the angle of the mandible is very prominent.
The hyoid has a transversely extended basi-hyal, a long
anterior cornu with three ossifications, and thyro-hyals which
are sometimes fused to the basi-hyal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chiroptera.</span> In the frugivorous Flying Foxes (Pteropidae)
the skull is elongated, and the cranial cavity is large
and arched, though considerably contracted in front. There
are commonly strong sagittal and supra-orbital crests. The
parietals take a great part in the formation of the walls of
the cranial cavity, the supra-occipital and frontals being small.
The frontal is drawn out into a long postorbital process, but
the zygomatic arch, which is slender, and formed mainly by
the squamosal and maxillae, gives rise to only a small postorbital
process, so that the orbit and temporal fossa are confluent.
There is no alisphenoid canal, and the tympanics are
very slightly connected with the rest of the skull. The mandible
has a large coronoid process, a rounded angle, and a transversely
expanded condyle.</p>

<p>In Insectivorous Bats the skull is generally shorter and
broader than in the Pteropidae. The cranial cavity is large
and rounded, and has thin smooth walls. The zygomatic
arch is slender, and postorbital processes are not generally
well developed. The premaxillae is generally small, sometimes
absent. The tympanics are ring-like and are not connected with
the surrounding bones. The angle of the mandible is distinct.
The hyoid in most respects resembles that of the Insectivora.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primates.</span> The characters of the skull differ greatly in
the two suborders of Primates, the Anthropoidea and the
Lemuroidea.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Lemuroidea</span></i> the general relative proportions of the
cranium and face are much as in most lower mammals, and the
occipital plane forms nearly a right angle with the basicranial
axis. The postorbital processes of the frontals are commonly
continued as a pair of ridges crossing the roof of the cranium
and meeting the occipital crest. Though the postorbital bar
is complete, the orbit and temporal fossa communicate freely
below it. The lachrymal canal opens outside the orbit, and the
lachrymal forms a considerable part of the side of the face.
The tympanic is developed into a large bulla. The hyoid
apparatus much resembles that of the Dog.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Anthropoidea</span></i> the skull differs greatly from that in
the Lemuroidea. The cranial portion of the skull is very
large as compared with the facial portion, though the
comparative development varies, some monkeys, such as the
baboons (Cynocephali) having the facial portion relatively large.
The comparative size of the jaws does not vary inversely with
the general development of the animal, some of the Cercopithecidae
having comparatively larger jaws than some of the
Cebidae. The great size of the cranial part of the skull is
mainly due to the immense development of the cerebral fossa,
which commonly completely overlaps the olfactory fossa in
front, and the cerebellar fossa behind. This development also
has the effect of making the ethmoidal and occipital planes lie,
not at right angles to the basicranial axis, but almost in the
same straight line with it. This is, however, not always the
case, as the Howling Monkey (<i>Mycetes</i>) and also some of the
very highest monkeys, the Gibbons (<i>Hylobates</i>), have the occipital
plane nearly vertical to the basicranial axis. In adult
Man the basi-occipital, exoccipitals and supra-occipital coalesce,
forming the so-called occipital bone; while the basisphenoid,
presphenoid, alisphenoids, orbitosphenoids and pterygoids form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
the sphenoid bone. The roof of the skull is partly formed
by the large supra-occipital and frontals, but mainly by the
parietals (fig. 99, 1), which in Man are of enormous extent.</p>

</table></div>   </div>

<p>In Man and in most monkeys, at any rate when young
(fig. 99, B), the roof of the skull is smooth and rounded, but
in many forms, such as the Baboons, in the adult the supra-orbital
and occipital ridges are much developed. In the Gorilla
this is also the case with the sagittal crest (fig. 99, A, 2). The
bones of the upper surface of the cranium interlock with wavy
outlines. The nasals vary much in length, being much shorter
in man than in most monkeys; they commonly become early
fused together, as do also the frontals. The vomer is well
developed, and the ethmo-turbinal always forms part of the
boundary of the orbit. There are frequently, as in many
Lemuroidea, a pair of more or less well-marked ridges, crossing
the roof of the skull from the postorbital processes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
frontals to the occipital crest. The orbit is completely encircled
by bone, and the alisphenoid assists the jugal and frontal in
shutting it off from the temporal fossa, leaving however a
communication between the two as the sphenomaxillary fissure.
In most cases the frontals meet one another in the middle line
between the mesethmoid and orbitosphenoid, but in Man, Simia,
and some Cebidae this does not take place. In nearly all
Cebidae the parietal and jugal meet one another, separating
the frontal and alisphenoid on the skull wall; in Man and all
Old World monkeys, on the other hand, the alisphenoid and
frontal meet and separate the jugal and parietal. The premaxillae
nearly always send back processes which meet the
nasals. The palate is rather short and both the palatine and
the premaxillae take a considerable part in its formation. The
pterygoid plate of the alisphenoid is decidedly large, and there
is no alisphenoid canal. There is never any great development
either of the paroccipital process of the exoccipital, or
of the postglenoid process of the squamosal. The periotic
and tympanic are always fused together; in Cebidae they
form a small bulla, but a bulla is not developed in any Old
World forms. The periotic is large, especially the mastoid
portion, which forms a distinct portion of the skull wall between
the squamosal and exoccipital. In Man and still more
in Old World monkeys, the external auditory meatus is drawn
out into a definite tube, whose lower wall is formed by the
tympanic; in the Cebidae the tympanic is ring-like. The
perforation of the periotic by the carotid canal is always
conspicuous.</p>

<p>The mandible is rather short and broad, and the angle
formed by the meeting of the two rami is more obtuse than in
most mammals. The coronoid process is fairly well developed,
and the angle is more or less rounded. In most Primates the
condyle is considerably widened, but this is not the case in
Man. In <i>Mycetes</i> the mandible is very large, its ascending
portions being specially developed. The hyoid of Primates is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
remarkable for the large expanded basi-hyal, which is generally
concave above and convex below. The anterior cornu is never
well ossified, but the thyro-hyal is always strong. In <i>Mycetes</i>
the basi-hyal is enormously large, forming a somewhat globular
thin-walled capsule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auditory ossicles.</span></p>

<p>There are in mammals four auditory ossicles forming a
chain extending from the fenestra ovalis to the tympanic
membrane. Three of these, the <b>malleus</b>, <b>incus</b> and <b>stapes</b>,
are always distinct, while the fourth, the <b>lenticular</b>, is smaller
than the others and is sometimes not distinct. The names are
derived from human anatomy and indicate in the case of the
first three a more or less fanciful resemblance respectively to a
hammer, an anvil and a stirrup. The ossicles are homologous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
as a whole to the hyomandibular of fishes and to the columellar
chain of Sauropsids and Amphibians. The malleus is homologous
to the extra-columella of Crocodiles and the stapes
to the columella. The <b>malleus</b> when typically developed
consists of a rounded <i>head</i> (fig. 100, 1) which bears a surface
articulating with the incus, and a short <i>neck</i> continued into a
process, the <i>manubrium</i> (fig. 100, 5), which comes into relation
with the tympanic membrane. From the junction of the neck
and manubrium two processes are given off, a <i>processus longus</i>
or <i>gracilis</i> (fig. 100, 4), which in the embryo is continuous
with Meckel's cartilage, and a <i>processus brevis</i> (fig. 100, 6).
The <b>incus</b> generally consists of a more or less anvil-shaped
portion which articulates with the malleus, and of a process
which is connected with the stapes by the small <b>lenticular</b>.
The <b>stapes</b> is generally stirrup shaped, consisting of a basal
portion from which arise two <i>crura</i> separated by a space the
canal through which a branch of the pharyngeal artery runs
The lenticular is frequently cartilaginous and sometimes is
not developed at all.</p>

<p>The above is the arrangement of the auditory ossicles met
with in the higher Mammalia, but in the lower Mammalia
the characters approach more nearly to those met with in
Sauropsids.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Monotremes</span> the ossicles, though distinctly mammalian
in character, show a very low type of development. The incus
is articulated, or often fused, with an outgrowth from the
head of the malleus. The stapes is very much like a reptilian
columella, having a single crus with no perforation.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Marsupials</span> the ossicles are of a low type, but not so
low as the rest of the skeleton might have led one to expect,
and all or almost all the points showing a low grade of development
may be paralleled among the Monodelphia. The
lowest Marsupials as regards the ossicles are the Peramelidae,
whose ossicles are of a frail papery consistence. The Didelphyidae
on the other hand have the most highly developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
ossicles, the malleus much resembling that of many Insectivores,
and the stapes having two definite crura separated by a canal.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Edentates</span> the character of the ossicles varies much.
In Sloths the stapes approaches that of Sauropsids in its
narrowness and the slight trace of a canal; this character
is however still more marked in <i>Manis</i>, whose stapes is as
Sauropsidan as that of Monotremes, and consists of a nearly
circular basal plate bearing a column which does not show any
sign of division into crura. The stapes of other Edentates,
such as ant-eaters, aard varks, and most armadillos, is of a high
type and has well-developed crura. <i>Priodon</i> has a lower type
of stapes than <i>Dasypus</i> and <i>Tatusia</i>.</p>

<p>The ossicles of the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> differ widely from those of all
other mammals in their great density and clumsy form.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> the ossicles are solid, though not so solid as in
Sirenia, and their details vary much. The malleus is always
firmly fused to the tympanic by means of the processus longus,
and the manubrium is very little if at all developed. The
incus has the stapedial end greatly developed, and the stapes
has very thick crura with hardly any canal. The ossicles of
the Mystacoceti are apparently less specialised than are those
of the Odontoceti.</p>

<p>The auditory ossicles of the <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> do not present any
characters common to all the members of the group.</p>

<p>Among Ruminants they are chiefly remarkable for the
development of a broad lamellar expansion between the head
and the processus longus of the malleus. In some cases the
malleus of the foetus differs strikingly from that of the adult.
Among Perissodactyla the Rhinoceros and Tapir have the
malleus of a low type, recalling those of Marsupials; while in
the Horse the head is well developed, and the malleus is of
a higher type.</p>

<p>The ossicles of <i>Procavia</i>, which recall those of the Equidae,
are chiefly remarkable for the small size of the body of the
incus. In Elephants the ossicles are large and massive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> (fig. 100, C) the malleus is generally
characterised by a very broad manubrium. In many genera
such as <i>Bathyergus</i>, and most of the Hystricomorpha such as
<i>Hystrix</i>, <i>Chinchilla</i> and <i>Dasyprocta</i>, the malleus and incus are
ankylosed together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnivora.</span> In Carnivora vera the most striking feature
of the malleus is the occurrence of a broad lamellar expansion
between the head and neck and the processus longus.
This however does not occur in some Viverridae. In the
Carnivora vera the incus and stapes are small as compared
with the malleus, but in the Pinnipedia they are large. In
the Pinnipedia the auditory ossicles have a very dense
consistence, and except in the Otariidae are very large. The
stapes frequently has no canal, or only a very small one.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the characters of the auditory ossicles are
very diverse. Many forms such as shrews, moles, hedgehogs,
and the Centetidae have a low type of malleus resembling that
of Edentates. <i>Chrysochloris</i> has very extraordinary auditory
ossicles. The head of the malleus is drawn out into a great
club-shaped process, the incus is long and narrow, and differs
much from the ordinary type.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the ossicles and especially the malleus much
resemble those of shrews. The stapes is always normal in
character, never becoming at all columelliform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primates.</span> In Man and the Anthropoid Apes the malleus
has a rounded head, a short neck, and the manubrium, a
processus longus and a processus brevis. The incus consists of
an anvil-shaped portion from which arises a long tapering
process. The stapes has diverging crura and consequently a
wide canal. The crura in other monkeys do not diverge so
much as in man and anthropoid apes. The New World monkeys
have no neck to the malleus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Sternum<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</span></p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Monotremes</span> and most <span class="smcap">Marsupials</span> the sternum does
not present any characters of special importance. The presternum
is strongly keeled in <i>Notoryctes</i>.</p>

<p>The sternum in <span class="smcap">Edentates</span> is very variable: in the Sloths
it is very long, the mesosternum of <i>Choloepus</i> having twelve
segments. In the ant-eaters and armadillos the presternum
is broad and sometimes as in <i>Priodon</i> strongly keeled. In
<i>Manis macrura</i> the xiphisternum is drawn out into a pair of
cartilaginous processes about nine inches long.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the sternum is simple and elongated, and
of fairly equal width throughout, in the adult it shows no sign
of segmentation. Its origin from the union of two lateral
portions can be well seen in <i>Manatus</i>.</p>

<p>Two distinct types of sternum are met with in the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span>.
In the Odontoceti the sternum consists of a broad presternum
followed by three or four mesosternal segments, but with no
xiphisternum. Indications of the original median fissure can
be traced, and are very evident in <i>Hyperoödon</i>. In the
Mystacoceti, on the other hand, the sternum consists simply
of a broad flattened presternum which is sometimes more or
less heart-shaped, sometimes cross-shaped. Only a single pair
of ribs are united to it.</p>

<p>The sternum in <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> is generally long and narrow and
formed of six or generally seven segments. The presternum
is as a rule small and compressed, often much keeled, especially
in the horse and tapir. The segments of the mesosternum
gradually widen as followed back and the xiphisternum is
often terminated by a cartilaginous plate.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the sternum is long and narrow and
generally has a large presternum, and a xiphisternum terminated
by a broad cartilaginous plate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span>, too, the sternum (fig. 76) is long and
narrow and formed of eight or nine pieces, all of nearly the
same size. The xiphisternum generally ends in an expanded
plate of cartilage.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the sternum is well developed but variable.
The presternum is commonly large and is sometimes as in the
Hedgehog (<i>Erinaceus</i>) bilobed in front, sometimes as in the
Shrew (<i>Sorex</i>) trilobed. It is especially large in the Mole
(<i>Talpa</i>) and is expanded laterally and keeled below.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the presternum is strongly keeled and
so is sometimes the mesosternum.</p>

<p>Among <span class="smcap">Primates</span>, in Man and the Anthropoid Apes the
sternum is rather broad and flattened; the mesosternum
consists of four segments which are commonly fused together
and the xiphisternum is imperfectly ossified.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Ribs.</span></p>

<p>Free ribs are borne as a rule only by the thoracic vertebrae;
ribs may be found in other regions, especially the
cervical and sacral, but these are almost always ankylosed to
the vertebrae. As a general rule the first thoracic rib
joins the presternum, while the succeeding ones are attached
between the several segments of the mesosternum. Some
of the posterior ribs frequently do not reach the sternum;
they may then be attached by fibrous tissue to the ribs in
front, or may end freely (<i>floating ribs</i>). There are generally
thirteen pairs of ribs, and in no case do they have uncinate
processes.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Monotremes</span> (fig. 102, B) each rib is divided not into
two but into three parts, an intermediate portion being interposed
between the vertebral and sternal parts. The sternal
ribs are well ossified, and some are very broad and flat. The
intermediate portions are unossified, those of the anterior ribs
are short and narrow, but they become longer and wider
further back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Marsupials</span> there are almost always thirteen pairs
of ribs, whose sternal portions are very imperfectly ossified.
<i>Notoryctes</i> has fourteen pairs of ribs, eight of which are floating:
the first rib is very stout, and is abruptly bent on itself
to join the sternum. It has no distinct sternal portion. All
the other ribs are slender.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Edentates</span> the Sloths have very numerous ribs;
twenty-four pairs occur in <i>Choloepus</i>, and half of these reach
the sternum. In the Armadillos there are only ten or twelve
pairs of ribs, but the sternal portions are very strongly ossified.
The first rib is remarkably broad and flat, and is not divisible
into vertebral and sternal portions.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> there are a very large number of ribs
noticeable for their great thickness and solidity, but not
more than three are attached to the sternum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cetacea.</span> In the Whalebone whales the ribs are remarkable
for their very loose connection both with the vertebral
column and with the sternum. The capitula are scarcely
developed, and the attachment of the tubercula to the transverse
processes is loose. The first rib is the only one connected
with the sternum. In the Toothed whales the anterior ribs
have capitula articulating with the centra, as well as tubercula
articulating with the transverse processes; in the posterior
ones, however, only the tubercula remain. Seven pairs of
well-ossified sternal ribs generally meet the sternum. In the
Physeteridae most of the ribs are connected to the vertebrae
by both capitula and tubercula.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> the ribs are generally broad and flattened,
and this is especially the case in the genera <i>Bos</i> and <i>Bubalus</i>
(fig. 101, 6). The anterior ribs are short and nearly straight,
and sternal ribs are well developed. The Artiodactyla have
twelve to fifteen pairs of ribs, the Perissodactyla eighteen or
nineteen, and <i>Procavia</i> twenty to twenty-two. The Elephant
has nineteen to twenty-one pairs, seven of which may be floating
ribs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> there are generally thirteen pairs of ribs,<span class="pagenum">[493]</span>
which do not present any marked peculiarities.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> have thirteen to fifteen pairs of ribs,
whose vertebral portions are slender, nearly straight and
subcylindrical, while their sternal portions are long and
imperfectly ossified (fig. 76, 5). There is nothing that calls
for special remark about the ribs, in either <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> or
<span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primates.</span> In Man and the Orang (<i>Simia</i>) there are generally
twelve pairs of ribs; in the Gorilla and Chimpanzee
(<i>Anthropopithecus</i>), and Gibbons (<i>Hylobates</i>), there are thirteen,
in the Cebidae twelve to fifteen, and in the Lemuroidea twelve
to seventeen pairs. The first vertebral rib is shorter than the
others, and the sternal ribs generally remain cartilaginous
throughout life, though in man the first may ossify.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Appendicular Skeleton.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pectoral Girdle.</span></p>

<p>By far the most primitive type of the pectoral or shoulder
girdle is found in the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span>. The scapula (fig. 102,
A, 1) is long and recurved, and has only two surfaces, one
corresponding to the prescapular[1] fossa, the other to the postscapular[1]
and subscapular<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> fossae. The coracoid is a short bone
attached above to the scapula and below to the presternum;
it forms a large part of the glenoid cavity. In front of the
coracoid there is a fairly large flattened epicoracoid (fig. 102, 6);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
there is also a large <b>T</b>-shaped interclavicle (fig. 102, 4),
which is expanded behind and rests on the presternum. The
clavicles rest on and are firmly united to the anterior border
of the interclavicle. This shoulder girdle differs greatly from
that of any other mammals, and recalls that of some Lacertilia.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Marsupials</span>, as in all mammals except the Monotremes,
the shoulder girdle is much reduced; there are no epicoracoids
and interclavicle, and the coracoid forms simply a small process
on the scapula, ossifying from a centre separate from that
giving rise to the rest of the bone. The scapula has a long
acromion, and a clavicle is always present except in <i>Perameles</i>.
Unossified remains of the precoracoids are found at either end
of the clavicle. The scapula of <i>Notoryctes</i> has a very high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
overhanging spine, and there is a second strong ridge running
along the proximal part of the glenoid border.</p>

<p>The shoulder girdle of the <span class="smcap">Edentata</span> shows some very
curious variations. In <i>Orycteropus</i> the scapula is of very
normal form and the clavicle is well developed. In the Pangolins
and Anteaters the scapula is very broad and rounded;
there is no clavicle in the Pangolins, and generally only a
vestigial one in Anteaters. In Armadillos, Sloths, and Megatheriidae,
the acromion is very long and the clavicle is well
developed. In the Sloths, <i>Megatherium</i>, and <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, a
connection is formed between the coracoid, which is unusually
large, and the coracoid border of the scapula, converting the
coraco-scapula notch into a foramen. In <i>Bradypus</i> the
clavicle is very small, and is attached to the coracoid, which
sometimes forms a distinct bone<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the scapula is somewhat narrow and curved
backwards: the spine, acromion, and coracoid process are
moderately developed, and there is no clavicle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cetacea.</span> In nearly all the Odontoceti the scapula is
broad and somewhat fan-shaped; the prescapular fossa is much
reduced, and the acromion and coracoid process form flattened
processes, extending forwards nearly parallel to one another.
Some of the Mystacoceti, such as <i>Balaenoptera</i>, have a broad,
fan-shaped scapula, with a long acromion and coracoid process,
extending parallel to one another. Others, such as <i>Balaena</i>,
have a higher and narrower scapula, with a smaller coracoid
process.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> the scapula is always high and rather narrow,
and neither acromion nor coracoid process is ever much developed.
In no adult Ungulate except <i>Typotherium</i> is there any
trace of a clavicle, but a vestigial clavicle has been described
in early embryos of sheep<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata vera.</span> In the Ruminantia the suprascapular<span class="pagenum">[496]</span>
region (fig. 103, 5) is very imperfectly ossified, and when this
is removed the upper border of the scapula is very straight
(fig. 101, 5). The spine is prominent, and generally has a
fairly well-marked acromion. In <i>Hippopotamus</i> the acromion
is fairly prominent, but in the other Suina, though the spine
is prominent, the acromion is not developed. The Perissodactyla
have no acromion, but while the Equidae and <i>Hyracotherium</i>
have the scapula long and slender, with the spine
very slightly developed, the other living Perissodactyla have
the spine prominent and strongly bent back at about the
middle of its length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subungulata.</span> <i>Typotherium</i> (Toxodontia) differs from all
other known Ungulates in having well-developed clavicles;
its scapula has a strong backwardly-projecting process, much
like that in <i>Rhinoceros</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phenacodus</i> (Condylarthra), has a curiously rounded
scapula, with the coracoid and suprascapular borders passing
imperceptibly into one another. The scapula resembles that
of a carnivore more than does that of any existing Ungulate.</p>

<p><i>Procavia</i> has a triangular scapula with a prominent spine
and no acromion; there is a large unossified suprascapular
region.</p>

<p>The scapula in the Proboscidea has a large rounded suprascapular
border and a narrow, slightly concave glenoid border.
The spine is large, and has a prominent process projecting
backwards from about its middle. The spine lies towards
the front end of the scapula, so that the postscapular fossa is
much larger than the prescapular fossa.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the shoulder girdle is of a rather primitive
type. The scapula is generally high and narrow, somewhat
as in Ruminantia; it differs, however, from the Ruminant
scapula in having a high acromion, which is often, as in the
Hares and Rabbits, terminated by a long metacromion. The
development of the clavicle varies, and sometimes it is altogether
absent. It is frequently connected by cartilaginous
bands or ligaments (fig. 104, 7 and 9), on the one hand with
the scapula, and on the other with the sternum. These unossified
bands are remains of the precoracoid. Epicoracoidal
vestiges of the sternal ends of the coracoids (fig. 104, 11) are
also often present.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Carnivora vera</span> the scapula is large, and generally
has rather rounded borders. The spine and acromion are well
developed, and the prescapular and postscapular fossae are
nearly equal in size. The coracoid is very small, and the
clavicle is never completely developed, being often absent, as
in the Bears and most of their allies. In the Seals (Phocidae)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the scapula is elongated and curved backwards, and has a very
concave glenoid border. In the Eared Seals (Otariidae) the
scapula is proportionally much larger and wider, the prescapular
fossa being specially large, and being traversed by a
ridge, which converges to meet the spine.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the shoulder girdle is well developed
and, as in Rodents, remains are met with of various parts not
generally seen in mammals. In the Shrews the scapula is
long and narrow, and has a well-marked spine, whose end
bifurcates, forming the acromion and metacromion. The
clavicle is long and slender, and is connected with the sternum
and acromion by vestiges of the precoracoid. Considerable
remains of the sternal end of the coracoid are also found. In
<i>Potamogale</i>, however, there are no clavicles. In the Mole the
shoulder girdle is greatly developed, and of very remarkable
form. The scapula is high and very narrow, with the spine
and acromion very little developed. The other shoulder girdle
element is an irregular bone, which articulates with the
humerus and presternum, and is connected by ligaments with
the scapula. This bone appears to represent both the coracoid
and the clavicle, being formed partly of cartilage bone, partly
of membrane bone.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the scapula is large and oval, and has
a moderately high spine and a large acromion. The coracoid
process is well developed and is often forked. The clavicles are
also well developed, and vestiges of the precoracoid and of the
sternal end of the coracoid are often found.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Primates</span> the clavicle and coracoid process are always
well developed. In Man and the Gorilla the scapula has a
long straight suprascapular border, a well-developed coracoid
process and spine, and a large curved acromion. Vestiges of
the precoracoid occur at each end of the clavicle. The shape
of the scapula varies much in the lower Primates.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Upper arm and Fore-arm.</span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span> the humerus is short, very broad at
each end and contracted in the middle. The radius and ulna
are stout and of nearly equal size, while the ulna has a greatly
expanded olecranon.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span> the humerus is generally a strong bone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
broad at the distal end and having well marked deltoid and
supinator ridges, which are specially large in <i>Notoryctes</i>. An
ent-epicondylar or supracondylar foramen (fig. 105, 5) is almost
always present except in <i>Notoryctes</i>. The radius and ulna are
always distinct and well developed, and a certain amount of
rotation can take place between them. The ulna of <i>Notoryctes</i>
has an enormous hooked olecranon which causes the bone to
be nearly twice as long as the radius.</p>

and ulna can be rotated on one another to a considerable
extent. The humerus in all other Edentates is very strong and
has the points for the attachment of muscles much developed,
especially in the Armadillos and Megatheriidae. An ent-epicondylar
foramen is found in all living forms. The radius
and ulna are well developed, but are not capable of much
rotation.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the humerus is well developed and of a
normal character. It is expanded at each end and has a
prominent internal condyle, a small olecranon fossa, and no
ent-epicondylar foramen. In the Dugong and <i>Rhytina</i> there
is a bicipital groove and the tuberosities are distinct, but in

coalesce. The radius and ulna are about equally developed
and ankylosed together at both ends.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> the arm bones are very short and thick.
The humerus has a globular head, and a distal end terminated
by two equal flattened surfaces to which the radius and ulna
are united. There is no bicipital groove, and the tuberosities
coalesce. The radius and ulna are flat expanded bones
fixed parallel to one another, but the ulna has a definite olecranon.
Scarcely any movement can take place between
them and the humerus, and in old animals the three bones are
often ankylosed together.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span> the humerus is stout and rather
short. The great tuberosity is always large and often overhangs
the bicipital groove, it is especially large in <i>Titanotherium</i>
(<i>Brontops</i>). There is never an ent-epicondylar foramen. The
radius is always large at both ends, but the condition of the
ulna is very variable. Sometimes, as in <i>Tapirus</i>, <i>Rhinoceros</i>,
<i>Macrauchenia</i>, Suina and Tragulina, the ulna is well developed,
and quite distinct from the radius; but in most forms, although
complete, it is much reduced distally, and is fused to the
radius. Sometimes, as in the Horse and Giraffe, it is reduced
to the olecranon and to a very slender descending process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
which does not nearly reach the carpus. In the Tylopoda,
though the ulna is complete and its distal end is often distinct,
it has coalesced with the radius throughout its whole length;
the olecranon is generally very large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subungulata.</span> In the large Condylarthra the humerus
has an ent-epicondylar foramen, and the radius and ulna are
stout bones nearly equal in size.</p>

<p>In <i>Procavia</i> the humerus is rather long, and has a very
prominent greater tuberosity, and a large supra-trochlear fossa,
but no ent-epicondylar foramen.</p>

<p>In the Proboscidea the humerus is marked by a greatly
developed supinator ridge, and is very long, longer than the
radius and ulna. The ulna has a remarkable development,
having its distal end larger than that of the radius, it has
also a larger articular surface for the humerus than has the
radius.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the humerus varies much in its development
according to the animal's mode of life. In the Hares it is long
and straight, with a small distal end, and a slight deltoid ridge.
In the Beaver on the other hand the deltoid and supinator
ridges are considerably developed. There is generally a large
supra-trochlear fossa, but no ent-epicondylar foramen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnivora.</span> In the Carnivora vera the humerus has large
tuberosities, a prominent deltoid ridge and a deep olecranon
fossa. The shaft is generally curved, and an ent-epicondylar
foramen is often found, though not in the Canidae, Hyaenidae,
and Ursidae. The radius and ulna are never united. The
radius (fig. 77, B) has a very similar development throughout
its whole length, while the ulna has a large olecranon (fig.
77, C, 11) and a shaft tapering somewhat towards the distal
end.</p>

<p>In the Pinnipedia the arm bones are very strongly developed.
The humerus has a very prominent deltoid ridge,
and the proximal end of the ulna and distal end of the
radius are much expanded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the arm bones are well developed, and
the radius and ulna, though sometimes united, are generally
distinct; as a rule there is an ent-epicondylar foramen, but this
is absent in the Hedgehog. The Mole has an extraordinary
humerus, very short and curved, and much flattened and expanded
at both ends. It articulates both with the scapula
and coraco-clavicle. The ulna has a greatly developed olecranon.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> both humerus and radius are exceedingly
long and slender; the ulna is reduced to little more than
the proximal end and is fused to the radius. There is no
ent-epicondylar
foramen.</p>

<p>All <span class="smcap">Primates</span> have the power of pronation and supination
of the fore-arm, by the rotation of the distal end of the radius
round that of the ulna.</p>

<p>In Man and the Anthropoid Apes the humerus is long and
straight, and has a globular head; neither of the tuberosities,
nor the deltoid nor supinator ridges are much developed. The
olecranon fossa is deep and there is no ent-epicondylar foramen.
The radius is curved and has a narrow proximal, and
expanded distal end, the ulna is straighter than the radius
and has the distal end much smaller than the proximal; the
olecranon is not much developed.</p>

<p>In the lower Primates, although the radius and ulna are
always quite separate, the power of pronation and supination
is not nearly so great as in the higher forms. In most of the
Cebidae and Lemurs an ent-epicondylar foramen occurs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Manus.</span></p>

<p>The Manus is divisible into two parts, viz. the carpus or
wrist, and the hand which is composed of the metacarpals and
phalanges. The carpal bones are always modified from their
primitive arrangement, sometimes more, sometimes less. One
modification however is always found in mammals, viz. the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
union of carpalia, 4 and 5 to form the <i>unciform</i> bone. Two
sesamoid bones are commonly developed, one on each side of
the carpus, the <i>pisiform</i> or one on the ulnar side being much
the larger and more constant: it has been suggested that
these represent respectively vestiges of a prepollex and a post-minimus
digit<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p>One or more of the five digits commonly present may be
lost, and sometimes all are lost except the third. The terminal
or ungual phalanges of the digits are commonly specially
modified to support nails, claws, or hoofs. There are as a rule
two small sesamoid bones developed on the ventral or flexor
side of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations, and sometimes
similar bones occur on the dorsal or extensor side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monotremata.</span> In <i>Echidna</i> the carpus is broad, the scaphoid
and lunar are united and there is no centrale. The
pisiform is large and several other sesamoid bones occur. Each
of the five digits is terminated by a large ungual phalanx. In
<i>Ornithorhynchus</i> the manus is more slender, but the general
arrangement is the same as in <i>Echidna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marsupialia.</span> The carpus has no centrale and the lunar
is generally small or absent. Five digits are almost always
present. In <i>Choeropus</i> however the only two functional digits
are the second and third, which have very long closely apposed
metacarpals; the fourth digit is vestigial, but has the normal
number of phalanges, while the first and fifth are absent. The
manus in <i>Notoryctes</i> is extraordinarily modified, the scaphoid
and all the distal carpalia are apparently fused, the first,
second, and fifth digits are very small, the third and fourth,
though having only one phalanx apiece, bear each an enormous
claw. Lying on and obscuring the ventral surface of the manus
is a large bone, probably a sesamoid.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="smcap">Edentata</span> there is a great diversity in the
structure of the manus, the centrale is however always wanting,
and except in <i>Manis</i> the scaphoid and lunar are distinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
In the Sloths the manus is very long, narrow, and curved,
and terminated by two or three long hooked claws, borne
by the second and third, or the second, third and fourth
digits. The fifth digit is absent, and the fourth is represented
only by a small metacarpal. In the Anteaters the third digit
is greatly developed and bears a long hooked claw. In <i>Myrmecophaga</i>
all five digits are fairly well though irregularly
developed, in <i>Cycloturus</i> the first, fourth, and fifth, are vestigial.
In the Armadillos the manus is broad, and has strongly
developed ungual phalanges. The digits, though almost always
five in number, vary much in their relative arrangement. In
<i>Dasypus</i> they are regular, but are remarkably irregular in
Priodon. The pollex is absent in Glyptodonts and in <i>Megatherium.</i>
In <i>Megatherium</i> the fifth digit is clawless while the
second, third, and fourth bear enormous claws. In the Manidae
the scaphoid and lunar are united; five digits are present,
the third and fourth being very large, and all being terminated
by deeply cleft ungual phalanges. In <i>Orycteropus</i> the pollex is
absent, while the other digits are terminated by pointed ungual
phalanges.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the general structure of the manus is quite of
the ordinary mammalian type. In <i>Manatus</i> most of the bones
of the carpus are distinct, but in <i>Halicore</i> many, especially
those of the distal row, have coalesced. The digits are always
five in number and have the normal number of flattened
phalanges.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span>, on the other hand, the manus is much
modified by the fact that the number of phalanges may be
greatly increased above the normal number of three, thirteen
or fourteen sometimes occurring in each digit. These are
believed to be duplicated epiphyses. In the Mystacoceti the
manus remains largely cartilaginous, in the Odontoceti it is
better ossified, and the phalanges commonly have epiphyses at
both ends. In <i>Physeter</i> the carpal bones also have epiphyses.
The carpus generally consists of six bones arranged in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
rows of three each. Five digits are generally present, but
sometimes as in <i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>, there are four, the
third being suppressed. Their relative development varies
much. The Sperm Whale which till recently was placed in the
entrance hall of the Natural History Museum at South Kensington
has one phalanx to the first digit, four to the second,
five to the third, four to the fourth, and three to the fifth.
Generally the manus is short and broad, but sometimes, as in
<i>Globicephalus</i>, it is much elongated owing to the great development
of the second and third digits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ungulata</span><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. The manus of the members of this great
order is of very great classificatory and morphological importance.
All the members agree in having the scaphoid and
lunar distinct, and in almost every case the ends of the digits
are either encased in hoofs or provided with broad flat nails.
It is by means of characters derived from the manus and pes
that the group is subdivided into the Ungulata vera and
the Subungulata.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span> the manus is never plantigrade,
and there are not more than four digits, the pollex being almost
always completely suppressed: in <i>Cotylops</i> among extinct Artiodactyla
however a vestigial pollex is found. The centrale is
absent, and the magnum articulates freely with the scaphoid,
and is separated from the cuneiform by the unciform and lunar.
All the bones of the carpus interlock strongly, and the axis of
the third digit passes through the magnum and between the
scaphoid and lunar.</p>

<p>There is a very strong distinction between the manus of
the suborders Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla. In the Artiodactyla
the axis of the manus passes between the third and
fourth digits, which are almost equally developed and, except in
the Hippopotami and some extinct forms such as <i>Anoplotherium</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
have their ungual phalanges flattened on their contiguous
surfaces.</p>

<p>In all <i><span class="smcap">Artiodactyla</span></i> the third and fourth digits are large, but
a gradual reduction in the second and fifth can be well traced.
Thus in the Suina the second and fifth digits, though smaller
than the third and fourth, are well developed and all four
metacarpals are distinct. In the Tragulina too all four metacarpals
are developed, and in <i>Dorcatherium</i> the third and fourth
commonly remain distinct as in the Suina. In the other Artiodactyla
however the third and fourth metacarpals are almost
always united, though indications of their separate origin
remain. In some Ruminantia, such as many Deer, the second
and fifth digits are reduced to minute splint bones attached
to the proximal end of the fused third and fourth metacarpals,
and to small hoof-bearing phalanges, sometimes attached to
splint-like distal vestiges of the metacarpals, sometimes altogether
unconnected with any other skeletal structures. In
some other Ruminants, such as the Sheep and Oxen, the only
remnants of the second and fifth digits are nodules of bone
supporting the hoofs, and in others, such as the Giraffe, <i>Anoplotherium
commune</i>, some Antelopes and the Tylopoda, all
traces of these digits have disappeared. The Camels differ
from all living Ungulata vera in not having the distal phalanges
completely encased in hoofs, and from all except the
Hippopotami in placing a considerable amount of the manus
on the ground in walking.</p>

<p>While the manus of the Artiodactyla is symmetrical about
a line drawn between the third and fourth digits, that of the
<i><span class="smcap">Perissodactyla</span></i> is symmetrical about a line drawn through the
middle of the third digit, which is larger than the others and
has its ungual phalanx evenly rounded and symmetrical in
itself. The most reduced manus in the whole of the mammalia
is found in the Horse and its allies, in which the third
digit, terminated by a very wide ungual phalanx, is the only
one functional. Small splint bones representing the second and<span class="pagenum">[508]</span>
fourth metacarpals are attached to the upper part of the third
metacarpal. In <i>Hipparion</i><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and other early horse-like animals
the second and fourth digits, though very small and functionless,
are complete and are terminated by small hoofs. In <i>Rhinoceros</i>
the second and fourth digits are equally developed
and nearly as large as the third, and reach the ground in
walking, a vestige of the fifth is also present. In the Tapir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
(fig. 106, A) and <i>Hyracotherium</i> the fifth digit is fully developed
but is scarcely functional. In <i>Titanotherium</i> (<i>Brontops</i>)
(fig. 106, B) it is nearly as well developed as any of the
others, and there is little or no difference between the relative
development of the third and fourth digits.</p>

<p>The Chalicotheriidae<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>, though distinctly Perissodactyles in
various respects such as their cervical vertebrae and teeth,
differ not only from all other Perissodactyles, but from almost
all other Ungulates, in the very abnormal character of their
manus. For while the carpus and metacarpus are like those
of ordinary Perissodactyles, the phalanges resemble those of
Edentates, each second phalanx having a strongly developed
trochlea, and each distal one being curved, pointed and deeply
cleft at its termination (fig. 106, C).</p>

<p>The Macraucheniidae, while agreeing with Perissodactyles
in having only three digits, with the limb symmetrical about
a line drawn through the middle of the third, have a carpus
which approaches closely to the subungulate condition, the
magnum articulating regularly with the lunar, and only to a
slight extent with the scaphoid.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Subungulata</span> the manus sometimes has five functional
digits, and a considerable part of it rests on the ground
in walking. The bones of the carpus retain their primitive
relation to one another, the magnum articulating with the
lunar, but not with the scaphoid. This character does not
however hold in the Toxodontia, for in most of the animals
belonging to this group the magnum does articulate with the
scaphoid. The corner of the scaphoid just reaches the magnum
also in Amblypoda.</p>

<p>As far as is known the <i><span class="smcap">Toxodontia</span></i> generally have three,
sometimes five digits to the manus, and the third is symmetrical
in itself&mdash;a Perissodactyloid feature.</p>

<p>In <i>Phenacodus</i> (fig. 107, B) (<i><span class="smcap">Condylarthra</span></i>) all five digits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>are well developed, the pollex being the smallest. The carpal
bones retain their primitive arrangement, the magnum articulating
with the lunar and not with the scaphoid. There is no
separate centrale.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Hyracoidea</span></i> (fig. 107, C) the manus is very similar
to that in <i>Phenacodus</i>, but a centrale is present and the pollex
is much reduced.</p>

<p>The manus of the <i><span class="smcap">Amblypoda</span></i>, such as <i>Coryphodon</i> (fig.
107, A) and <i>Uintatherium</i>, is short and broad, with five well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
developed digits and large carpal bones. The carpals however
interlock to a slight extent, and the corner of the magnum
reaches the scaphoid.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Proboscidea</span></i> the manus is very short and broad, with
large somewhat cubical carpals which articulate by very flat
surfaces and do not interlock at all. All five digits are present,
and none of them are much reduced in size. The manus in
Proboscidea and in <i>Coryphodon</i> is subplantigrade.</p>

<p>In the Tillodontia the manus is plantigrade and has pointed
ungual phalanges, in this respect approaching the Carnivora.
It differs however from that of all living Carnivora in having
the scaphoid and lunar distinct.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the manus nearly always has five digits with
the normal number of phalanges: the pollex may however be
very small as in the Rabbit, or absent as sometimes in the
Capybara. The scaphoid and lunar are generally united, and
a centrale may be present or absent. In <i>Pedetes caffer</i> the
radial sesamoid is double and the distal bone bears a nail-like
horny covering. In <i>Bathyergus</i> the pisiform is double. It is
upon these facts that the contention for the former existence
of prehallux and post-minimus digits has partly been based.</p>

<p>In living <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> the scaphoid, lunar and centrale are
always united, forming a single bone. All five digits are
present, but as a rule in Carnivora vera the pollex is small, and in
<i>Hyaena</i> is represented only by a small metacarpal. Sometimes,
as in Cats and Dogs, the manus is digitigrade, sometimes, as in
Bears, plantigrade. The ungual phalanges are large and pointed,
and in forms like the Cats, whose claws are retractile, they
can be folded back into a deep hollow on the ulnar side of the
middle phalanx; a small radial sesamoid is often present.</p>

<p>In Pinnipedia the manus is large and flat and the digits
are terminated by ungual phalanges which are blunt (sea lions
and walrus), or slightly curved and pointed (seals). The pollex
is nearly or quite as long as the second digit, and as a rule
the digits then successively diminish in size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>The Creodonta differ from living Carnivora in the fact that
the scaphoid and lunar are usually separate.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the scaphoid and lunar are sometimes
united, sometimes separate, and a separate centrale is usually
present. There are generally five digits, but sometimes the
pollex is absent. In the Mole the manus is greatly developed
and considerably modified. It is very wide, its breadth being
increased by the great development of the radial sesamoid
which is very large and sickle-shaped. The ungual phalanges
are also large and are cleft at their extremities.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the manus is greatly modified for the
purpose of flight. The pollex is short and is armed with a
rather large curved claw, the other digits are enormously
elongated, the elongation in the case of the Insectivorous bats
being mainly due to the metacarpals, and in the Frugivorous
bats to the phalanges. In the Frugivorous bats the second
digit is clawed as well as the pollex, in other bats this claw is
always absent, and so is often the ungual phalanx, the middle
phalanx then tapering gradually to its termination.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Primates</span> as a rule the manus is moderately short and
wide. The carpus has the scaphoid and lunar distinct, and
generally also the centrale; sometimes however, as in Man,
the Gorilla, Chimpanzee, and some Lemurs, the centrale has
apparently fused with the scaphoid. There are almost always
five well-developed digits, but in the genera <i>Colobus</i> and <i>Ateles</i>
the pollex is vestigial.</p>

<p>The magnum in man is the largest bone of the carpus. The
pisiform also is well developed, but there is no radial sesamoid.
In Man, the Gorilla, Chimpanzee, and Orang, the carpus articulates
only with the radius, in most Primates it articulates
also with the ulna. The third digit of the Aye-Aye (<i>Chiromys</i>)
is remarkable for its extreme slenderness.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pelvic Girdle.</span></p>

<p>The pelvic girdle in all mammals except the Sirenia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
Cetacea consists of two halves, usually united with one another
at the symphysis in the mid-ventral line, and connected near
their upper ends, with the sacral vertebrae. Each half forms
one of the <i>innominate</i> bones, and includes at least three separate
elements, a dorsal bone, the ilium, and two ventral bones, the
ischium and pubis. Very often a fourth pelvic element, the
acetabular or cotyloid bone, occurs.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span> the pelvis is short and broad, and the
pubes and ischia meet in a long symphysis. The acetabulum
is perforated in <i>Echidna</i> as in birds, but not in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>.
A pair of elongated slender bones project forwards from the
edge of the pubes near the symphysis; these are sesamoid bones
formed by ossifications in the tendons of the external oblique
abdominal muscles, and are generally called <i>marsupial bones</i>.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span> the ilia are generally very simple,
straight, and narrow, while the pubes and ischia are well developed
and meet in a long symphysis. Marsupial bones are
nearly always prominent, but are not developed in <i>Thylacinus</i>
or <i>Notoryctes</i>. The ischium often has a well-marked tuberosity
and in Kangaroos the pubis bears a prominent pectineal
process on its anterior border close to the acetabulum. The
pelvis in <i>Notoryctes</i> differs much from that in all other Marsupials,
the ilium and ischium being ankylosed with six vertebrae
in a manner comparable to that of many Edentates.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Edentata</span> the pelvis is generally well developed, but
the symphysis is very short. In the Sloths the pelvis is rather
weak and slender, the obturator foramina are very large and
the ischia do not meet in a symphysis. In the Megatheriidae
the pelvis is exceedingly wide and massive, and is firmly
ankylosed with a number of vertebrae. In the Armadillos,
Glyptodonts, Anteaters, and Pangolins it is much developed
and firmly united to the vertebral column by both the ilia and
the ischia. In <i>Orycteropus</i> however the ischium does not
become united to the vertebral column, and the pubis generally
has a strongly developed pectineal process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> the pelvis is quite vestigial. In the Dugong
it consists on each side of two slender bones, one of which
represents the ilium and the other the ischium and pubis; the
two bones are placed end to end and are commonly fused
together. The ilium is attached by ligament to the transverse
process of one of the vertebrae. In the Manatee each half
of the pelvis is represented by a triangular bone connected by
ligaments with its fellow and with the vertebral column. In
neither Manatee nor Dugong is there any trace of an acetabulum
but one can be made out in <i>Halitherium</i>.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> the pelvis is even more vestigial than in
the Sirenia, consisting simply of a pair of small straight bones
which probably represent the ischia, and lie parallel to and
below the vertebral column at the point where the development
of chevron bones commences.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span> the pelvis is generally rather long and
narrow. The ilium is flattened and expanded in front (fig.
103, 8), but becomes much narrower and more cylindrical
before reaching the acetabulum. Both pubis and ischium
contribute to the symphysis which is often very long. The
ischia are large and have prominent tuberosities, especially in
Artiodactyles. In most Ruminantia there is a deep depression,
the supra-acetabular fossa above the acetabulum, but this is
not found in the Suina or Tylopoda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subungulata.</span> In <i>Procavia</i> the pelvis is long and narrow,
and bears resemblance to that in Artiodactyles.</p>

<p>The Proboscidea have a very large pelvis set nearly at
right angles to the vertebral column; the ilium is very wide,
having expanded iliac and gluteal surfaces, and a narrow
sacral<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> surface. The pubes and ischia are rather small, but
both meet their fellows in the symphysis. <i>Uintatherium</i> (suborder
Amblypoda) also has a large and vertically placed pelvis
(fig. 108) with a much expanded ilium. The pelvis however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
differs from that of the Proboscidea in the fact that the ischia
do not meet in a ventral symphysis.</p>

<p>In many <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the ilia have their gluteal, iliac, and
sacral surfaces of nearly equal extent; in the Hares, however,
the gluteal and iliac surfaces are confluent. The pubes and
ischia are always well developed and sometimes, as in the
Hares, the acetabular bone also. In these animals the pubis
does not take part in the formation of the acetabulum, and
the ischium bears on its outer side a well-marked ischial
tuberosity.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Carnivora</span> the pelvis is long and narrow. The
iliac surfaces (fig. 78, A, 5) are very small and the sacral large;
the crest or supra-iliac border is formed by the union of the
sacral and gluteal surfaces. The symphysis is long and includes
part of both pubis and ischium. The ischial tuberosity (fig.
78, A, 10) is often well marked, and sometimes as in <i>Viverra</i>
the acetabular bone is distinct. In the Pinnipedia the pelvic
symphysis is little developed, or sometimes not developed at
all, and the obturator foramina are remarkably large.</p>

<p>In some <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> such as <i>Galeopithecus</i>, there is a long
pelvic symphysis, in others such as <i>Erinaceus</i> and <i>Centetes</i>, it is
very short, in others again such as <i>Talpa</i> and <i>Sorex</i>, there is no
pelvic symphysis. The acetabular bone is exceptionally large
in <i>Talpa</i> and <i>Sorex</i>.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the pelvis is small and narrow, and in the
great majority of cases the two halves do not meet in a ventral
symphysis. The pubis has a strongly developed pectineal
process, which occasionally unites with a process from the
ilium enclosing a large pre-acetabular foramen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primates.</span> In Man and the Anthropoid Apes the pelvis is
very large and wide, and the ilium has much expanded iliac
and gluteal surfaces. The symphysis is rather short and formed
by the pubis alone. The acetabulum is deep and the obturator
foramen large, and there is frequently a well-marked ischial
tuberosity. In the lower Anthropoidea the ilium is long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
narrow and has a small iliac surface. The ischial tuberosities
are large in the old world monkeys.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span> the femur is short, rather narrow in
the middle, and expanded at each end. The great and lesser
trochanters are large and about equally developed, but there is
no third trochanter. The fibula is very large and is expanded
at its proximal end, forming a flattened plate much resembling
an olecranon. The patella is well developed.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span> there is no third trochanter to the
femur, the fibula is well developed but not the patella as a
general rule. <i>Notoryctes</i> has a femur with a prominent ridge
extending some little way down the shaft from the great trochanter;
the tibia has a remarkably developed crest, and the
fibula has its proximal end much expanded and perforated;
there is an irregularly shaped patella closely connected with
the proximal end of the tibia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edentata.</span> In the Sloths the leg bones are all long and
slender. The femur has no third trochanter, and the fibula is
complete and nearly equal in size to the tibia. In the Megatheriidae
the leg bones are extraordinarily massive, the circumference
of the shaft of the femur in <i>Megatherium</i> equalling
or exceeding the length of the bone. There is no third trochanter
in <i>Megatherium</i>. In most of the remaining Edentata
the leg bones are strongly developed. The femur in the Armadillos
and Aard Varks has a strong third trochanter, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
tibia and fibula are both large and are commonly ankylosed
together at either end. The limb bones are very massive also
in the Glyptodonts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sirenia.</span> In no living Sirenian is there any trace of a
hind limb, but in <i>Halitherium</i> a vestigial femur is found,
which articulates with the pelvis by a definite acetabulum.</p>

<p>In the Mystacoceti among the <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span> small nodules of
bone or cartilage occur connected with the vestigial pelvis,
and may represent the femur and tibia. No trace of the
skeleton of the hind limb is known in the Odontoceti.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span> the femur is noticeable for the size
of the great trochanter (fig. 109, 2); there is no definitely
constricted neck separating the head from the rest of the
bone, and the lesser trochanter (fig. 109, 3) is not very prominent.
All Perissodactyles except the Chalicotheriidae show
a strongly marked third trochanter, but this is absent in all
known Artiodactyles. The development of the fibula in general
corresponds to that of the ulna. In <i>Rhinoceros</i>, <i>Macrauchenia</i>,
<i>Tapirus</i> and the Suina it is distinct and fairly well developed;
in the Tragulina on the other hand it is vestigial, being reduced
to the proximal end only. In the Ruminantia and Tylopoda
also, it is much reduced forming merely a small bone attached
to the distal end of the tibia, sometimes, as in the Red deer
a slender vestige of the proximal end also is preserved quite
detached from the distal portion; in the Horse this proximal
portion is all that there is found of the fibula. The progressive
diminution of the fibula can be well seen in the series of forms
that are regarded as the ancestors of the Horse. The patella
of the Ungulata vera is well ossified, but fabellae<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> are not
usually found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subungulata.</span> Of the Toxodontia, <i>Toxodon</i> has no third
trochanter while <i>Typotherium</i> and <i>Astrapotherium</i> have one.
In the Condylarthra the femur has well-marked lesser and
third trochanters, and the fibula and patella are well developed.
In the Hyracoidea there is a slight ridge on the femur in the
place of the third trochanter, the fibula is complete, but is
generally fused to the tibia at its proximal end.</p>

<p>Of the Amblypoda, <i>Coryphodon</i> has a third trochanter, but
<i>Uintatherium</i> has none; in this respect, in the vertical position
and general appearance (fig. 108) of the limb, and in the
articulation of the fibula with the calcaneum, the leg of
<i>Uintatherium</i> closely approaches that of the Proboscidea.</p>

<p>In the Proboscidea the femur is very long and straight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
the development of trochanters is slight, and the fibula though
slender is complete and articulates with the calcaneum.</p>

<p>A third trochanter is found in the Tillodontia.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the femur is variable, the great trochanter is
generally large and so sometimes is the third as in the Hares.
In most Rodents as in the Beaver the fibula is distinct, sometimes
as in the Hares it is united distally with the tibia. The
patella is well developed, and so too are the fabellae as a
general rule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnivora.</span> In the Carnivora vera the femur (fig. 79, A)
is generally rather straight and slender, and has a very distinct
head. The fibula (fig. 79, C) is always distinct and there is
generally a considerable interval between it and the tibia.
Fabellae (fig. 79, 7) are commonly present.</p>

<p>In the Pinnipedia the femur is short, broad and flattened,
having a prominent great trochanter. The fibula is nearly as
large as the tibia, and the two bones are generally ankylosed
together at their proximal ends.</p>

<p>The Creodonta differ from all living Carnivores in having
a femur with a third trochanter.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> a third trochanter is sometimes
developed. The fibula is sometimes distinct, sometimes fused
distally with the tibia, thus differing from that of a Carnivore.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the femur is straight, slender and rather
short, with a small but well-developed head. The fibula may
be well developed or quite vestigial or absent. Owing to the
connection of the hind limb with the wing membrane the knee
joint is directed backwards.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Primates</span> the femur is rather long and slender, having
a nearly spherical head and large great trochanter. The tibia
and fibula are always distinct and well developed. Fabellae
are not found in the highest forms but are generally present
in the others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Pes.</span></p>

<p>The skeleton of the pes is in most respects a counterpart
of that of the manus. Just as in the manus if one digit is
absent it is the pollex, so in the pes it is the hallux. But
while in the manus the third digit is always well developed,
however much the limb may be modified, in the pes any of the
digits may be lost. In all mammals the tibiale and intermedium
fuse to form the <i>astragalus</i>, and the fourth and fifth
tarsalia to form the <i>cuboid</i>. Sesamoid bones are considerably
developed. In almost every case the phalanges and first metatarsal
have epiphyses only on their proximal ends, while the
remaining four metatarsals have epiphyses only on their distal
ends.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Monotremata</span> all the usual tarsal bones are distinct,
and the five digits have the normal number of phalanges.
Several sesamoid bones are developed, the most important one,
found only in the male, being articulated to the tibia and bearing
the curious horny spur. The ungual phalanges of the pes like
those of the manus, are deeply cleft at their extremities. In
the Echidnidae the pes is turned outwards and backwards in
walking.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Marsupialia</span> the pes is subject to great modifications,
but in every case the seven usual tarsal bones are distinct.
In the Didelphyidae the foot is broad, all five digits are
well developed, and the hallux is opposable to the others.
In the Dasyuridae the foot is narrow, and the hallux may be
very small, or as in <i>Thylacinus</i> completely absent. In <i>Notoryctes</i>
the pes is much less abnormal than the manus, and
all five digits have the usual number of phalanges. The fifth
metatarsal has a curious projecting process, and there is a
large sesamoid above the hallux. In the Wombats (Phascolomyidae)
the foot is short and broad, the digits are all distinct,
and the hallux is divaricated from the others.</p>

<p>In the remaining marsupials the second and third metacarpals
and digits are very slender, and are enclosed within a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
common integument. This condition is known as <i>syndactylism</i>,
and its effect is to produce the appearance of one toe with two
claws. In the Kangaroos (Macropodidae) the pes is very long
and narrow, owing to the elongation of the metacarpals. The
fourth digit is greatly developed, the fifth moderately so,
while the hallux is absent, and the second and third digits
are very small. The Peramelidae have the foot constructed
on the same plan as in the Kangaroos, and in one genus
<i>Choeropus</i> the same type of foot is carried to a greater
extreme than even in the Kangaroos. Thus the fourth digit
is enormously developed, the second and third are small, and
the fifth smaller still, while the hallux is absent. In the
Phalangers and Koalas though the second and third toes are
very slender, the hallux is well developed and opposable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edentata.</span> In the Sloths the pes much resembles the
manus, being long and narrow, but in both genera the second,
third and fourth digits are well developed. Most of the other
Edentates have a but little modified pes with the normal
number of tarsal bones and the complete series of digits. In
<i>Cycloturus</i> however the hallux is vestigial and it is absent
in Glyptodonts. <i>Megatherium</i> has a greatly modified pes, the
hallux is absent, and the second digit vestigial, while the
third is very large, having an enormous ungual phalanx. The
calcaneum too is abnormally large.</p>

<p>No trace of the pes occurs in either <span class="smcap">Sirenia</span> or <span class="smcap">Cetacea</span>.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Ungulata</span> the pes like the manus is subject to
much variation and is of great morphological importance.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Ungulata vera</span> the pes is never plantigrade and
never has more than four digits, the hallux being absent.
The cuboid always articulates with the astragalus, and the
tarsal bones strongly interlock. As was the case also with the
manus, the pes is formed on two well-marked types characteristic
respectively of the Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Artiodactyla.</span></i> Just as in the manus, the third and
fourth digits are well and subequally developed; their ungual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
phalanges have the contiguous sides flat, and the axis of the limb
passes between them, and between the cuboid and navicular.
The astragalus has both the proximal and distal surfaces
pulley-like, and articulates with the navicular and cuboid by
two facets of nearly equal size. The calcaneum articulates
with the lower end of the fibula if that bone is fully developed.</p>

<p>In the Suina four toes are developed, and though in the
Peccaries the third and fourth metatarsals are united, they
are all distinct in most members of the group, as are all
the tarsal bones. In the Hippopotami the four digits are of
approximately equal size, and the middle ones do not have
the contiguous faces of their ungual phalanges flattened.</p>

<p>In the Tragulina the cuboid, navicular, and two outer cuneiforms
are united forming a single bone; all four metatarsals
are complete and the two middle ones are united. In the
Tylopoda and <i>Anoplotherium commune</i> only the third and
fourth digits are developed, their metatarsals are free distally,
but are elsewhere united. In the Ruminantia the cuboid and
navicular are always united and so are the second and third
cuneiforms, while in <i>Cervulus</i> all four bones are united
together. The third and fourth metatarsals in Ruminants
are always united in the same way as are the third and fourth
metacarpals, while the second and fifth are always wanting.
In Deer the second and fifth digits are usually each represented
by three small phalanges, but in the Giraffe and most
Bovidae the bones of these digits are wanting.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Perissodactyla</span></i> the pes like the manus is symmetrical
about a line drawn through the third digit; this line
when continued passes through the external cuneiform, navicular
and astragalus. The astragalus has its distal portion
abruptly truncated, and the facet by which it articulates with
the cuboid is much smaller than that by which it articulates
with the navicular. The calcaneum does not articulate with
the fibula. The tarsus in <i>Macrauchenia</i> like the carpus
differs from that of other Perissodactyles and resembles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
of Subungulates in having the bones arranged in lines with
little or no interlocking. The calcaneum resembles that of
Artiodactyles in having a small facet for articulation with the
fibula. <i>Tapirus</i> (fig. 110, A), <i>Rhinoceros</i> (fig. 110, B) and
<i>Titanotherium</i> have a short and broad foot with the usual
tarsal bones and three well-developed digits,&mdash;a number never
exceeded by any Perissodactyle. From this tridactylate limb
a series of stages is exhibited by various extinct forms leading
gradually to the condition met with in the Horse (fig. 110, D)
in which the third toe is greatly developed, while the second
and fourth are reduced to slender metatarsals attached to the
proximal half of the third metatarsal.</p>

<p>In <i>Chalicotherium</i> and <i>Agriochoerus</i> the pes has the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
abnormal characters as the manus, the digits being clawed and
the ungual phalanges in <i>Chalicotherium</i> deeply cleft.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Subungulata</span> the pes is sometimes plantigrade and
pentedactylate, the cuboid sometimes does not articulate with
the astragalus, and the tarsal bones sometimes do not interlock.</p>

<p>In <i>Typotherium</i> (<i><span class="smcap">Toxodontia</span></i>) the hallux is absent and the
other four digits are well developed; in <i>Toxodon</i> and <i>Nesodon</i>
the pes is tridactylate. The tarsal bones have the regular Subungulate
arrangement, the cuboid not articulating with the
astragalus. The calcaneum articulates with the fibula as in
Artiodactyles. The astragalus in most forms, but not in
<i>Astrapotherium</i>, resembles that of the Ungulata vera in having
a grooved proximal surface.</p>

<p>In <i>Phenacodus</i> (<i><span class="smcap">Condylarthra</span></i>) the tarsus is very little
modified, five digits are present, the first and fifth being small
and not reaching the ground.</p>

<p>In <i>Procavia</i> only the three middle digits are present with
a vestige of the fifth metacarpal.</p>

<p>In the <i><span class="smcap">Amblypoda</span></i> the pes (fig. 108) is very short and
broad, all five digits are functional, and at any rate in
<i>Coryphodon</i> plantigrade, the hallux being the smallest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
astragalus is very flat, and the tarsals interlock to a slight
extent, the cuboid articulating with both calcaneum and
astragalus.</p>

<p>The pes in the <span class="smcap"><i>Proboscidea</i></span> much resembles that in the
Amblypoda, but differs in that the astragalus does not articulate
with the cuboid, the tarsals not interlocking at all.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rodentia</span> the structure of the foot is very variable.
In Beavers the foot is very large, all five digits being well
developed; the fifth metatarsal articulates with the outer side
of the fourth metatarsal, and not with the cuboid, and there
is a large sesamoid bone on the tibial side of the tarsus. In
the Rats, Porcupines and Squirrels, there are five digits, in the
Hares only four, and in the Capybara and some of its allies
only three. In the Jerboa (<i>Dipus</i>) a curious condition of the
pes is met with, as it consists of three very long metatarsals
fused together and bearing three short toes, each formed of
three phalanges. <i>Lophiomys</i> differs from all other Rodents
in having the hallux opposable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnivora.</span> In the Carnivora vera the pes is regular and
shows little deviation from the normal condition. All the
usual tarsal bones are present, but sometimes as in the Dogs,
Cats, and Hyaenas, the hallux is vestigial. Sometimes as in
the Bears the pes is plantigrade, sometimes as in the Cats and
Dogs it is digitigrade. In this respect and in the character
of the ungual phalanges, the pes closely corresponds with
the manus. In the Sea Otter (<i>Latax</i>) the foot is large and
flattened and approaches in character that of the Pinnipedia.</p>

<p>In the Pinnipedia the pes differs much from that in the
Carnivora vera. In the Seals in which the foot cannot be
used for walking, and is habitually directed backwards, the
first and fifth digits are much longer and stouter than any
of the others. In the Sea Lions which can use the pes for
walking, the digits are all of nearly the same length, and
in the Walrus the fifth is somewhat the longest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span> the pes is almost always normal, and
provided with five digits.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Chiroptera</span> the pes is pentedactylate, and the digits
are terminated by long curved ungual phalanges. In some
genera the toes have only two phalanges. The calcaneum is
sometimes produced into a long slender process which helps
to support the membrane between the leg and the tail.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="smcap">Primates</span> Man has the simplest form of pes.
In Man all five digits are well developed, the hallux being
considerably the largest. Sesamoid bones occur only under
the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the hallux.</p>

<p>In the other Primates the internal cuneiform has a saddle-shaped
articulating surface for the hallux, which is obliquely
directed to the side of the foot and opposable to the other
digits. Two sesamoid bones are usually developed below
each metatarso-phalangeal joint, and one below the cuboid.
The second digit in Lemurs, and all except the hallux in
<i>Chiromys</i> have pointed ungual phalanges; in all other cases
the ungual phalanges are flat. In some of the Lemuroidea,
especially <i>Tarsius</i>, the tarsus is curiously modified by the
elongation of the calcaneum and navicular.</p>

<p class="noin"><b>Lectures on the History of Physiology</b> during the<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Demy 8vo. With a Frontispiece. 9<i>s.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Nature.</i> There is no more fascinating chapter in the history of science
than that which deals with physiology, but a concise and at the same time
compendious account of the early history of the subject has never before
been presented to the English reader. Physiologists therefore owe a debt
of gratitude to Sir Michael Foster for supplying a want which was widely
felt.... No higher praise can be given to the book than to say that it is
worthy of the reputation of its author.... It is by no means an easy task to
do adequate justice to the mine of literary and historic research which the
author has laid open to view.</p>

<p><i>Guardian.</i> We must urge not merely students of physiology, but all
those interested in the history of modern thought, to buy and read the
book.... The present volume has a charm and fascination which is too often
wanting in historical studies. His portraits live, and live in a live world;
they are not mere dead pictures set in a stereotyped, historical framework.</p>

<p><i>Spectator.</i> We can recommend this admirable and suggestive book
with confidence to all, laymen or doctors, who wish to trace the gradual
growth of man's knowledge of the physical basis of his life.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nature.</i> It is not necessary to recommend the perusal of the book to
all interested in the subject since it is indispensable to them, and we will
merely conclude by congratulating the Cambridge University Press on
having added to their admirable series of Natural Science Manuals an
eminently successful work on so important and difficult a theme, and the
author on having written a treatise cleverly conceived, industriously and
ably worked out, and on the whole, well written.</p>

<p><i>Revue Scientifique.</i> Nous ne pouvons entrer dans le détail; mais il est
évident que M. Seward, praticien distingué lui-même, est très au courant
des travaux des autres, il les cite et utilise abondamment; et ceci est fait
pour inspirer confiance. Au total, son &oelig;uvre est appuyée sur des bases
solides, et elle restera sans doute longtemps le bréviaire, le manuel de ceux
qui veulent, non pas seulement s'initier à la paléobotanique, mais retrouver
les renseignements qui sont épars dans des centaines de monographies qu'on
a souvent peine à se procurer. Le livre de M. Seward fait partie des
<i>Cambridge Natural Science Manuals</i>, et il est digne de cette collection, qui
est elle-même digne du foyer scientifique universellement réputé, où il a vu
le jour.</p>

<p><i>Guardian.</i> We have already alluded to the spirit of caution which
characterises the book, and we may add that it promises to be most helpful
to the botanist who would extend his researches into the past.</p>

<p><i>Natural Science.</i> A most successful treatment of a difficult subject.
All of importance is brought forward and impartially discussed.... Such a
book has long been a desideratum. Mr Seward's style is clear and concise,
and the many pitfalls into which beginners are apt to stumble are clearly
pointed out.</p></blockquote>
